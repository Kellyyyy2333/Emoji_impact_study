Great example thanks for adding this ❤️ 
Normally we try to write POSIX shell where possible. Also `[[ $output ]]` isn't checking `$?` but the old code intended to do so. We need something like this:\\    [ $? -eq 0 ] && echo \"✔ ${output}\" || (echo \"✘ ${output}\"; false)

Yeah it's running out of `shared` so we don't waste time scanning the other dirs.  eslint finds the eslintrc in the parent dir fine:\```sh\ λ pwd                          client/shared (cjb/DESKTOP-1017-eslint ⚡) caius\/home/cjb/go/src/github.com/keyb

Ah ok I take ☝️ back it is useful to have access to the template directory in the hooks.\I think the docs would benefit from an example that shows this off.
Better to point at a URI instead of a license file. The header is assuming that the file has been broken out of context so the license file is likely not there. Below is my std header for MIT:\```\# © YEAR LasLabs Inc.\# License MIT (https://opensourc
`©` instead of `(c)`.
❤️  In this case I think the collection should dictate the component's state.
`'✔ '` should probably be stored in a constant at the top of the file. I believe it’s never a good idea to have inlined constants.\\```js\if (text.substring(0 PASSED_ASSERTION_TOKEN.length) === PASSED_ASSERTION_TOKEN) {\  // …\}\```
`'✖ FAILED [ '` should probably be stored in a constant at the top of the file. I believe it’s never a good idea to have inlined constants.\\```js\if (text.substring(0 FAILED_ASSERTION_TOKEN.length) === FAILED_ASSERTION_TOKEN) {\  // …\}\```
✂️ extra space at the end.
Updated for _MAXIMUM CHALLENGE_ ⚡ \\:joy:
If we're going for a slot based approached then we should simply be able to pass elements here (not an object). e.g.:\\```js\<Carousel nextButton={<span>▶</span>} prevButton={<span>◀</span>} />\```

❌ confirm-button is not used
❌ is not used
❌ is not used.\???? it has sense to rename 'gender' stuff to 'sex' because sex is better word word in this case.
⚠️ as only state['signUp'] is used in _onStateChange it is better to subscribe only on that data instead of whole state (map -> where ->)
❓ do we need this call? Is it possible that when you load component there will be sign-up data with error in the state?
✏️ Rename sendSignUpForm to something like sendSignUpData and do appropriate renamings for related items (actions etc.) 
❌ sign-up-button is not used
❓ Should we subscribe for all state changes on init or it is better to subscribe once on send form data?
❓ why isConfirmationCodeResend is taken from state instead of taking it from signUp data which comes to method?
❌ await/async are redundant here
❓ What is global errorCode in the state?
⚠️ Sign-in link should be always shown
⚠️ remove property instead making in null (.remove('signUp'))
⚠️ ❓ what does resendConfirmCode do in shared actions creators? it is signup form only functionality:exclamation:
✏️ sendSignUpData should be just data. In this case semantic is broken

❓Is mappable already needed here? What if I just want to read the JSON value and no model is available? Or are we to make models explicitly required when using `Faro`? Which is good I think it's like this in Bolero and I kinda like it.

Fine then it's a matter of preference and expectations (especially regarding readability). ✅

❗️ This (`end_of_line`) is not correct for all systems. Line endings for a project in Git should be controlled by **.gitattributes** so this line needs to be omitted from **.editorconfig** altogether.

Just ✂️ the `-> { uniq }` lambda and it should work. ???? 
✅ (note you can be more specific than \"more than once\" -- the old procedure checks each pair exactly twice)

✅ but be careful with notation: it's O(n²) not O(n)²
✅ (not the answer I was looking for but correct for your answer to part g)

This will break UTF-8 text because UTF-8 uses bytes from the Windows-1252 128-159 range. e.g. It would turn é (c3a9) into Ã© (c383c2a9). I don't think you need any iconv here at all.

❓ Any reason we are not simply passing in the exception as an argument to `LOGGER.error` and printing out the stack trace instead of only printing `e.getMessage()`? Also does this really need to be logged as error?
❗️ Feels like we could \"merge\" L75-83 with `loadPropertiesFile()` and do `return loadProperties(propertyFile)` here instead. Thoughts?
❓ Any specific reason we're taking in the full `Map` instead of just the profile name?
❗️ We need to make sure `propertiesFile` isn't a directory.
✏️  This comment is a little confusing. The instances are either immutable or they are not. Since the class has setters I don't think we should say that it _enforces immutability_.
❓ If we keep the `Map` should we specify which keys will be used?
✏️  This makes it sound like `update` can be used instead. We may want to clarify this a little or remove it.
❓ Those are unusual exceptions to catch. Should we just catch `RuntimeException` instead?
✏️  How about `PropertiesFileReader` or `PropertiesFileParser`?
❗️ Don't we need to test the new `updateGuestClaimsProfile()` method?

Ugh -> backwards compatibility -> ☎️ 
❓ do we have any auto prefixing machinery? I'm not sure offhand if iOS safari still requires the `-webkit` prefix for flex stuff (i believe desktop safari might still require it)
❓ Should we test the reverse case i.e. old metacard has a POC but the new one doesn't?
❓ Also what should happen if the email address is ever `null`? Not sure if it's possible but something to consider.
❓ For all the update tests that use a list should we add another \"fake\" metacard to test the list processing logic?
❓ Nice use of the xor operator here! So rarely used that I had to look it up :-)\Another (simpler?) option would be to do `return newPointOfContact != oldPointOfContact`.\We could remove the `else` block too.
✏️  We usually try to put `private` methods after `public` ones.
❗️ We should add a test for missing email address if it's a valid case.
❓ Instead of having to go back to the properties on L52 to get `subjectName` and casting it here do you think we could change `setSubjectOnRequestProperties()` and have it return a `ddf.security.Subject` object? That'd save a few lines and make this cast
❓ Any reason we took out the `point-of-contact` check?
✏️  Short JavaDoc comment would be nice.
✏️  Might be worth extracting the metacard creation logic to a `private` method especially if we add multiple of them to the list (see next comment).
Ha neat ✨

❓ Should we make this class `abstract`? I don't think we should allow anyone to instantiate this class.
❗️ Before we do anything else we should validate that `metacardId` isn't `null` or empty. Right now the unit test passes only because we use the `URISyntaxException` thrown by the `new URI` calls below. This will make it difficult to figure out that `Ill
❗️ If this ever happens it most likely indicates that there's a bug in the code or some bad interactions between plug-ins. I'm ok with not failing but should we at least up the logging level so we know something is wrong?
❓ If we make `ProcessItemImpl` `abstract` can we remove this test class since we already test the `null` metacard scenario in the other test classes?
❓ Since we have this unit test class for `ProcessCreateItemImpl` do you think we should add one test that builds a valid instance and makes sure that all fields are properly set and another one that tests the `markMetacardAsModified`?
❗️ We should be able to eliminate a lot of duplication between the three `submit*()` methods by extracting a `private` method that takes the right plugin method to call inside the for loop.
❗️ Checked with @pklinef and updating the metacards and content items independently could cause issues (i.e. content item and meta data out-of-sync) so we should change this logic and keep them together and update them both at the same time.
❗️ The `ProcessResourceItem` interface doesn't say that `getProcessResource` can return `null` (https://github.com/codice/ddf/blob/master/catalog/async/catalog-async-data-api/src/main/java/org/codice/ddf/catalog/async/data/api/internal/ProcessResourceItem
❗️ We should use a `reference-listener` here like we do for all the other plugins (e.g. https://github.com/codice/ddf/blob/master/catalog/core/catalog-core-standardframework/src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint/plugins.xml) to make sure our list of plug
❓ Should this return an `ImmutableList` (http://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/ImmutableList.html) or a copy of `processItems` to guarantee that instances remain immutable?\Might be worth adding a note in the Java
❓ Should we add the `metacardId` and `qualifier` to the exception message?
❓ I'm assuming that we're using `HashSet`s here to avoid updating the same `ContentItem` or `Metacard` twice. However it looks like `ContentItemImpl` doesn't implement `hashCode` or `equals` so this may not work for those objects.
❓ Should we test the happy path as well?
ehm wrong conversation? Missunderstanding? I just asked for a little codechange. ☺️ 
❓ Since all the logic of this class pretty much revolves around those maps do you think we should add a comment on each one that describes what they contain? I usually like when the name itself explanatory but in this case I think it'd be real difficult

❗️ We should remove/replace _Embedded_ from the caption.
✏️  We should check with @ricklarsen on how we can make the bulleted lists look ok in tables. Right now they all render as `*` and everything is on the same line in the PDF document.
❓ Since we have all the pros and cons in the same cell I wonder if we should either keep them together or mark them with something like `+` for pros and `-` for cons or something.
✏️  We need a space between `(Administrative)` and `Tools`.
✏️  We should link to the section.
❗️ We should also mention that configuration and administration (e.g. replication sharding etc.) is needed and can be complex.\\❓ Should we consider renaming the next row to be only `Administration` and move some of those (installation configuration
❓ Not sure what this means.
✏️  Add links to the other two sections. And as @oconnormi mentioned above we should be consistent with the names we use.
✏️  The interface is actually called `CatalogProvider` so we should keep the word Catalog.
❗️ We should remove this sentence since `catalog-solr-server` is the only feature available and it is needed for all 3 configuration options.
❓ Should we use the same sentence we used for the embedded configuration?
❗️ Since the external configuration is used to point to an external Solr we may want to use a different URL here e.g. `https://solr-host-name:8993/solr` or something similar.
❗️ Using standalone here makes things somewhat confusing since we have a separate section for the standalone configuration option later. We probably want to line up our terms and only use external when the Solr server runs on a separate machine and standa
✏️  This property also applies to all configurations. We should be consistent and mention it in all of them or none of them.

✏️  _gives the user **the** ability_?
❓ Should we remove this sentence? Doesn't seem to make much sense here.
❗️ This section seems to contradict the previous paragraph. Does standalone mean running within the distribution or outside on its own machine?
❓ Not sure if this still makes sense. @pklinef?
❓ Since this would also apply to the external configuration should we move it to a common section? We may also want to consider what to do with the hostname we use. `localhost` makes sense if the provider is running within DDF but it may be confusing if
❗️ Backup and restore sections apply to both external and standalone so they should be common sections.
✏️  _the **the** Solr Cloud cluster_
❓ Should we say _needs to be highly available and fault tolerant_ and add something about capacity needs?
❓ Should we say _setting up Solr Cloud_ since DDF HA isn't really an option today?
❓ Instead of this sentence should we add _ which may effect performance and stability_ to the previous one? Word _bug_ here doesn't sound too good ;-)
✏️  Add _More Zookeeper nodes can be added to achieve greater fault tolerance. The total number of nodes must however always be an odd number._ or something similar?
❓ Instead of specifying the root directory should we use something like `$SOLR_INSTALL_DIR`?
✏️  Can we eliminate one of the two _minimum_ in the sentence.
✏️  We should \"monotype\" the file paths and names property names and values URLs etc.\\And to be consistent we probably should explain this the same way we did for the other configurations.

❓ Should we put the \"pros\" first?
✏️  Should we use _secured_ instead of _secure_ here?
❓ Should we split this one in two and indicate that the overhead applies only for the external deployment case?
❓ Pros first?
❓ Should we list the no Solr Admin UI as a separate bullet?
✏️  Should we be consistent and always use Solr Admin _UI_?
❓ Should this be a note?
✏️  The bullets are a little inconsistent here. They should either all start with _the_ and be like a sentence or just be a list of things e.g. running ${branding} Kernel etc.
✏️  _A_ minimum of three Zookeeper nodes _is_ required?
❓ Not sure why we quote _node_ here.

✏️  Instead of a comment I'd recommend extracting a `private` method with a clear name. That way there's no chance the comment will ever become stale.
❓ General question regarding these tests. Should we always add some other permissions and make sure those are not implied by the plug-in?
❗️ This test really validates two things so we may either want to split it up into different test methods or extract `private` methods that group and clearly tell what we're testing.
❓ Are we sure we can always safely cast to `KeyValuePermission` here or should we have a `filter(permission instanceof KeyValuePermission)` before the cast?\\If so then you should be able to skip the cast altogether and do this instead:\```\matchAll
✏️  Could use `@{link}` or `{@code}` for those class references.
✏️  `private` method instead of comment?
❗️ We may want to add a `serviceManager.waitForRequiredBundles(\"sample-metacard-filter\")` call here to make sure the bundle is really up and ready.
❓ Should we mention that this is done only in `processPreUpdate` and `processPostQuery` and explain why?
✏️  `<p>` and `</p>` elements not needed.
✏️  Move `public` method at the top?
If I was looking into code only this looks like an unnecessary hack but... I love how you take care of all those subtleties! ❤️ 
@pypingou I'm explicitly setting date_testing \"truthy\" here so I didn't think it made sense to then test that it is truth immediately afterwards. If I did that I'd just be making sure that Python works ☺
✏️ Should mention `isModified` default value as well.
✏️ To be consistent we may want to extract a private method (`getContentItemKey(metacard contentItem)`?) that returns the key and use that everywhere.
❓ Just thought of something. Maybe we should also catch `RuntimeException` here to make sure we clean things up even when something unexpected happens.
❓ `| RuntimeException`?
✨ thanks for covering this case.

Doh I meant _abstract_ ????‍♂️ 
No worries ☕️ By the way I would rather keep the variable because:\1) local consistency: `categories` is not used a second time\2) readability: all those list comprehensions casting to tuples sets and tuples again makes the code hard to read.

❓ Wonder if we should log something when we exit this loop to let admins know that file polling has stopped and that the application/bundle needs to be restarted if the loop stopped because the thread was interrupted but the application is still running.
❓ Is this really a blocking call? It's not clear from the documentation. If not we may want to have some kind of sleep between `checkAndNotify` calls to prevent a busy loop.
❗️ This is pretty bad if it happens because configuration files will not be processed anymore. We may want to bump up the logging level here (WARN?) and say that the application/bundle needs be restarted.
❓ Any reason we've reordered these? One of the purposes of the test was to make sure that the status command could be run once and report both files as failed.
❓ Couldn't we use a `IOFileFilter` when we create the `FileAlterationObserver` instead of doing this every time this method gets called?
❓ Do you think we could have used the `FileAlterationMonitor` to replace this whole class?
❗️ We should use a constant instead of hardcoding `2000` here and on L192.
❓ Can't we inject `FileAlterationObserver` instead of creating it here? Would make mocking and unit testing easier.

❓Since these methods will only be called when `register` is called and `changeListener` is set do we still need this check?

✏️  Could we move this in a `@Before` method?
✏️  Instead of inlining this class everywhere could we create a static inner class and use that instead?
✏️  Just noticed that this class uses the `@NotNull` annotation. We changed our convention since we wrote this class to assume nothing should be `null` unless we use `@Nullable`. Feel free to remove those if you want.
❓ Could we do `when(file.getPath()).thenThrow(new RuntimeException())` instead of relying on `Paths.get()` throwing an exception? Another option would be to overwrite `waitForFileToBeCompletelyWritten()` and have it throw the `RuntimeException`.

❗️ We should add a few more child metacards to our lists to make sure we cover all the possible cases handled by the stream (e.g. missing empty or non-String `FRAME_CENTER` attribute) contained in the `extractChildFrameCenters()` private method. 
❓ Do we need to verify that the sub-sample count is set to `MAX_SIZE` first and then always reset to its original value here and in the test methods even when there's an exception (since it's in a `finally` block)?
❗️ We should test that calling `end` before `update` throws an exception.\❗️ We should also test that the `RolloverActionException` is silently ignored in the `update()` method.
❗️ We should add some unit tests for this.
❗️ We should consider capturing the argument passed to the `query` method and verify that the `QueryRequest` objects passed in contain the expected values i.e. start index batch size etc.
❗️ We should add a few more locations or tests to cover all the edge cases handled by the streams in `doUpdateField()` and `extractChildLocations()` e.g. `GeometryUtility.wktToGeometry()` returns nothing `geometries` ends up empty `Metacard:getLocatio
❗️ We should have tests for a geometry that's not a `LineString` and a sub-sample count that's `null`.
❓ Should we mark this class as `@NotThreadSafe` as well so we're consistent with the other classes that extend the same base class?
❗️ We should also test for the cases where we get no `childLocations` no `geometries` and no `coordinates` in `doUpdateField()`.
❗️ We should have tests for the `UnsupportedQueryException` `SourceUnavailableException` `FederationException` and `RuntimeException` to properly test all the exception scenarios in `handleParentMetacard()`.

❌ `addArtifactFiles()` should check whether it already ran e.g. by having an `artifactFiles` list which it clears when called the first time. Otherwise mutliple calls to `getFiles()` will give wrong results.

✖️ Ok this one is mind-boggling. First of all the `DISTINCT` is superfluous with the `GROUP BY` but the `id` and `name` aren't used later other than for logging. If your `GROUP BY` change is enough great just please remove that weird `DISTINCT`.

❌ Unrelated to this review but I feel we should separate these two things: Evaluating a project and cross-configuring another project (subprojects/allprojects/...). Can you open a card for that?
⭕️ Why did we remove the UnmanagedThreadOperation class? It seems like a useful encapsulation of this logic.
❌ This doesn't look right we used to set running= false on the parent now we're doing it on the current one. Is there missing test coverage or am I missing something?
⭕️ Same here this should probably be a nested class now.
❌ The workers shouldn't need to know about parent operations.
⭕️ This doesn't seem worth a method
❌ Should take the built description instead of calling .build() itself.
⭕️ It would be nice to extract this into an inner class now and inline the \"computeDetails\" stuff there.
❌ Shouldn't need to know about the parent.
⭕️ Outdated Javadoc
❌ For now let's switch back to the previous behavior of these IDs and clean that up in another step. I.e. use `Object` here and set it to the current `OperationIdentifier`.
⭕️ I feel this looked nicer before with the UnmanagedThreadOperation subtype
⭕️ Outdated JavaDoc. The purpose of this class and BuildOperationExecutor are fundamentally different now. This class manages low-level locks BuildOperationExecutor manages operations. 
❌ Should we really allow this? Does this case happen somewhere currently?
⭕️ I find this unhelpful as JavaDoc. It's more of an implementation comment and can't be understood without some pretty deep knowledge about the current state of the code base and where we might want to go. It would be nice to have some real JavaDoc about

❓ This code is new to me. Where would I look to see that it's fine to omit the value as opposed to an approach like this:\\```csharp\builder.WriteUTF8(info.LocalName ?? string.Empty);\```
Missing `return`. As a result the failure of this promise chain is recognised by mocha while running a different test. After I added `return` the test is failing with the following error:\\```\      ✖ fails to find \"Auth\" common model\ERROR: 'undefi
Ah I see. I guess I misunderstood ???? I can change it to return a Surelock instance. That's clearer anyway since a Builder in a class should return the class itself ????‍♂️ \\If I do that should I make the constructor and `initialize()` method private?

❓ Is the directory really called `$data` with the `$` in front of it or is that a typo?\✏️  SolrCloud should be one word.
❓ What happens if this (or any other SolrCloud-only) option is provided for a single-node Solr? Would the option be ignored or will the command fail? Should we add that to the command and/or parameter descriptions?
✏️  Should we extract a method for the `if` block like we did for the else block (e.g. `performSolrCloudBackup()` or `handleSolrCloudBackup()`)?

Sadly there's no callback or error event. But if the function doesn't exist it should never be called and it's an API that to my mind only Firefox implements. So it shouldn't ever fail... ????‍♀️ 
⭕️ Should be inside the build operation class
❌ Should take the operation context as an argument.
❌ We shouldn't introduce locking into this hot code path. The previous solution with `state.running` only used a volatile read which is more efficient. We should either go back to that or use a concurrent map.
⭕️ Of the executing thread
❌ I think this needs to be done in a finally block
⭕️ `return operation` would be clearer
❌ Can be removed no one ever calls this.
❔ does this `Does` function need to exist at all?
❔ Should this be `ValueText`? Doesn't seem like it matterns for the `__arglist` case (since you can't write `_\\u005farglist` for example) but I can't say for sure that it doesn't make a difference elsewhere.

Yup this one is 100% my fault.  No clue why I named it that ????‍♂️

I'll treat ????‍♂️ as a yes then.
✏️ We have a few double-spaces in those descriptions.
Too bad ☹️\\❓Any reason we can't just call `getCloudSolrClient()` directly and get rid of `getSolrClient()`?
❗️Can we rename this class to `BackupCommandTest` to match our naming guidelines?
❓Not sure how long this can take but would it be worth printing out a message saying that the optimization process is in progress before calling `optimize`? A debug log might be useful as well.
❗️We should split this test in two one to test the async backup on its own and one to test the status part.
❗️We're missing tests for the following cases:\* Backup status fails and returns error messages\* `CollectionAdminRequest.requestStatus(requestId).process(client)` throws an `Exception`\* Optimize collection fails and returns error messages\* Optimize
❓If `shutdown` and `getSolrClient` are meant to be used by sub-classes should we make them `protected`?
❗️If we make this method `protected` we should either add `@Nullable` on the return type or change it to throw an exception instead of returning `null`.
❗️We should do like we did in the `getBackupStatus()` method and print out any error messages returned in the `CollectionAdminResponse` otherwise the admin will have no way to know why the backup failed. Hopefully we can share that code between those two
❓Instead of returning a `boolean` should we just throw an exception?\❓Is this a work-around or a permanent solution? If it's the former should we create a ticket and add a `TODO` with the ticket number to know this needs to be removed when the problem 
❓Wonder if we shouldn't improve `AbsolutePathResolver` to return an absolute `Path` given a file name and use it here to get the path instead of hard-coding `ddf.home`?
❓Should we have a constant for this message? If we mention the command namespace and name we may want to have and use constants for those as well in case they ever change in the future. We could also keep it simple and output something like `Invalid Argu

❗️Need JavaDocs.
❓Is this `true` only when all result statuses are commit succeeded? Do skipped operations considered successful or not?\❓Should this method be called `hasTransactionSuceeded()` instead?
❓Should we provide a way to filter on more than just the `factoryPid` i.e. service properties?
❓Do we really need this when clients can do `! getFailedResults.isEmpty()`?
❓Splitting the original interface helped quite a bit. I wonder however if there isn't a risk of this one becoming bloated over time. I can already think of other operations than could be added e.g. `createConfigurationFile(Path file String content)` `
✏️ Nit: _service_ instead of _library_?
❗️We need to make it clear that the `key` provided here is the `String` returned by the `Configurator` methods. Using something else than `String` would help too.
✏️ Since we use `factoryPid` in the parameter description of the `createManagedService` method should we be consistent and use `configPid` here instead of `configId`?
❓Does this need to be an absolute or relative path? If the latter what will it be relative to? Any other constraints e.g. must be under the system's installation directory cannot contain symbolic links etc.?
❗️Since this class is part of a public API bundle should we have JavaDoc comments and descriptions for the class methods parameters and return values?
❗️We need to be more specific on the `Path` i.e. absolute relative to installation directory always under the installation directory symlinks acceptable etc.
❓ What happens once a commit has failed? Can the `Configurator` instance be used again? What if `commit` is called again after a failure? Should we consider making each instance usable only once? See my comment on the `ConfiguratorFactory` class.
❓Since the `Configurator` is \"created\" using a factory should we consider making each `Configurator` an object that can be used only once? In other words clients would get a new `Configurator` perform operations on it and then call `commit`. At that po
❓Should this method be called `hasOperationSucceeded()` instead to avoid confusion with `OperationReport.isOperationSucceeded()`?
❓Can the `Map` contain `null` values?
❓Why did we choose to make the `ConfigReader` accessible through a factory instead of making it a service?
✏️ We may want to specify how those are interpolated in the audit message i.e. log4j `{}` style Java's `String.format` style etc.
❗️Do we really need a mutator method in the interface? It makes it impossible for the SPs to implement as an immutable class.
❗️Should we document what happens (`IllegalArgumentException` or `NoSuchElementException`?) when an invalid parameter is provided e.g. `bundleSymName` doesn't exist?\Same question for all the methods in this interface.
❓We should specify what \"failed\" means in this context. Commit failed rollback failed skipped all of those etc.\We could also consider making this method a little more generic and taking in a `Status` parameter that filters the results instead.
❓What sequence of events could cause an operation to get in the `COMMIT_FAILED` state and remain there?\❓Instead of using an `enum` could we create sub-classes of `Result` and `ConfigurationException` to capture an operation's result and reason for fail
✏️ Nit: We could use `{@code true}` and `{@code false}` in the comments.
❓Should we consider defining some kind of `OperationId` class or something similar instead of returning a `String`? Using `String` always makes things more confusing when used between class like in this case and tend to get \"abused\" over time.

❗️Instead of using `when().thenAnswer()` to validate the `queryRequest` we should do this at the end of the method using `verify` and an `ArgumentCaptor` (https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/1.10.18/org/mockito/ArgumentCaptor.html).
✏️ Class could be package-private.
❗️When we switch to using `verify` we should also make sure all the right value are passed to the factory and avoid using `any()` as much as possible.
❗️ Same for `CacheCommitPhaser`.
❗️ Somehow we're not getting coverage on the while loop in `OffsetResultHandler.run()`. We may need to change this test and/or add new ones to make sure we cover all possible paths.\\Since the `OffsetResultHandler.run()` method contains many conditions
❗️ We need to test that `setMaxStartIndex()` works as expected when the index is <= 0.
❗️We need to make sure any exception thrown by `PreFederatedQueryPlugin` are caught and ignored (L264).
❗️Need to test the case where the start index is higher than the max start index (L233-234).
❗️ General comment on all the tests: we need to make sure we have `verify` calls with the proper argument matchers for all the dependencies the `CachingFederationStrategy` is using otherwise the unit tests may not fail when a breaking change is introduce
❗️ We need to verify that `SolrCache.create()` was called with the expected metacards (L404).
❗️We need to make sure `PreFederatedQueryPlugin` stop processing when `StopProcessingException` is thrown (L268).
❗️Since the constructor doesn't specify that arguments can be `null` we should add unit tests for those cases and add the proper validation.
❗️ We may want to rethink how `CallableSourceResponse` is written so we can cover all the possible paths and conditions including L590-594 which aren't currently covered.
❗️We need a test for the `process(CreateResponse)` method.
❗️We're missing a test for the case where the source is a `CatalogProvider` and the site ID matches the current site (L273-279).

❓ Is `solr.query.rows` something we expect admins to know about or is it for our own internal use?\❗️ We should consider using `NumberUtils.toInt(System.getProperty() 2_000_000_000)` instead.
It may be easier to read and fit the existing code style but I keep getting errors from `grunt lint`:\```\  406:10  error  'scout' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\\✖ 1 problem (1 error 0 warnings)\```\I don't actually call the `scout` me

❓ Extract the number of retries to a constant?
❓ `-DskipStatic=true`?

so ⚪️  is nice to have yea it be great if you can implment it it would be nice if we are smart when it comes to storing \\keep in mind this can be tricky  identifying the \"same picutre\"  also please evaluate the cost of doing it  
❓ Should we ignore here or let the exception bubble up? Looks like the message `Profile: %s not found` if this exception occurs right now which might be misleading. Thoughts?
❓ Constant for `\"profile-\"`?
❗️ It looks like these 3 setters are only used for unit testing. Could we make them package-private instead? Alternatively we could also create a package-private constructor that takes those in as arguments.
✏️  This could be a constant (`protected static final PROFILE_PATH`).
✏️  Should we be a little bit more explicit here and say that the `Optional` will be empty if the file cannot be found or read?
✏️  Weird formatting here. And since this is a `protected` method we probably should give a short description for each argument.
❗️ I don't think that these can be `null` in a production scenario since we haven't marked them optional: https://github.com/apache/karaf/blob/e90bf7e82a3e71e5ac53aea6a836dd7a83fdf477/shell/core/src/main/java/org/apache/karaf/shell/impl/action/command/Man
❓ Any reason those are `protected` instead of `private`?
❓ Instead of `admin:*` should we use `profile:*` and not have to use hyphens between words?
✏️  Should this be `message item` instead of `Operation Message: item` to match both argument names and what the code already does? Should the code add the `:` for the caller?\Same comment for all the other print methods.
`strict-type-predicates` would have caught that. ⚡️ 
❗️ We need to test that the `IOException` is properly handled when `Files.list(profilePath)` is called in `listProfileFiles()`.
❓ Should we consider extracting the `if` bodies to `private` methods e.g. `startDefaultProfile(optionalProfile.get())` and `startExtraProfile(optionalExtraProfiles.get())`.
✏️ Should we use a guard check here to simplify the flow a little?\\```\if (!optionalProfile.isPresent() && !optionalExtraProfiles.isPresent()) {\    printError(String.format(\"Profile: %s not found\" profileName));\    return;\}\```
❓ Looks like `getBundle()` will throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if `bundle` doesn't exist. We should make sure adding a `catch (RuntimeException e)` in `execute()` is good enough.
❗️ Don't think we want to use the `assert` keyword in unit tests. We should use `assertThat()` instead.
❗️We need to test the following paths in `uninstallInstallerModule()`:\* `admin-post-install-modules` is already installed\* `admin-modules-installer` feature is installed\* `featuresService.installFeature(\"admin-post-install-modules\" ...)` throws an 
❓ Looks like the four `ADVANCED_PROFILE` constants are only used in `ProfileInstallCommand`. Should we move them there instead of having them here?
❓ If we end up in this catch block we can't guarantee that the application is in a consistent state. Should we recommend re-installing from scratch?
❗️ We should throw something else than `RuntimeException` here. `IllegalStateException` maybe?
❓ Should we consider providing a message when we throw an exception and use that when we print the failure message in `AbstractProfileCommand` L94?
❗️ `featureObject` can be `null` here: https://github.com/apache/karaf/blob/master/features/core/src/main/java/org/apache/karaf/features/internal/service/FeaturesServiceImpl.java#L623.
❗️ Instead of doing this we should consider injecting the `Security` object using `Security.getInstance()` and have a setter our tests can use to mock it. That way we could make this method `private` and not have to sub-class in the unit tests.
❗️ We may want to add a `catch (RuntimeException e)` to log and print out a message saying an unexpected error occurred.
❗️Since we catch the exception and don't re-throw it we will end up printing the success message on L76. We may want to be consistent and let the exception bubble up to the `execute()` method and let it handle what message should be printed out.\❓This m

❕ Need tests for each of the allowed underlying enum types (prime candidate for a `[Theory]`)\\❕ Need a test for an enum without `[Flags]` so future changes in behavior won't go undetected.

Never hurts to double check ✅ ✅ 
❗️ Even though other commands do this we should use something else than `RuntimeException` here e.g. `IllegalStateException` or such.
✏️  Since this is meant for unit testing and is package-private should we add a `// For unit testing` comment and move at the bottom of the class?
❗️ We need to be clear that these methods will _not_ add the `: ` and that the caller has to do it.
❗️ Still need to fix this.
✏️  _\"An unexpected error occurred during the installation process. The system is in unknown state. It is strongly recommended to restart the installation from the beginning.\"_?
❗️ Since this is only used by the `ProfileInstallCommand` should we move this member variable and the `setProfilePath` to that class instead of having it here?

❓ Should we mention the property name in the comment?
❓ Should we consider making this part of the `@Before` and `@After`?
❓ Are we testing that basic auth over TLS v1 isn't working? If so we may want to give the method a better name or add some JavaDoc comments.
❓ If those tests are making sure that basic auth works using different versions of TLS we may want to add that information to the method names.
❓ Should this be a constant instead?
❓ Should we move this to the `@After` method and get rid of all those `finally` blocks?
You're right and I generally agree but the ship has sailed. at this point ☹️

❌ Would not store mean returning `0` here and below? We at least need to add this to the Javadoc. My same feeling as for the load result above applies here.
❌ How about making `ServiceHandle` an `AutoCloseable` and then use `CompositeStoppable`?
❌ Seems like logging the store operation got lost here.
❌ The counting needs some test coverage. Especially testing if packing and unpacking yield the same file count on various occasions.\⭕️ Currently we also also counting the root directories. This is fine. I wonder if we should somewhat also track  how l

❗️ Now that we've removed all those commented out lines I just realized that this test doesn't do anything anymore. We should do like we did for the WSF 1.0 test class and open a ticket to get this class fixed.
✏️  Something is still wrong with the formatting... There shouldn't be any spaces between the parameter names and descriptions.

❗️ We should add a unit test to cover the case where the name couldn't be found.
✏️  We should keep all the `public` methods at the top of the class instead of having the `protected` and `private` ones. Makes it easier to see what the tests are without having to scroll way down.
❓ See my question about security above. If we can ignore security we should be able to get rid of this class and simplify the component test configuration and maintenance.
❓ Do we absolutely need to include the security framework in these tests? If this component doesn't do anything special security-wise we should be able to safely assume security works and not have to pull it in.

❗️ Doesn't look like this method is needed anymore.
❗️ This `Map` is not used and should be removed. Native mode should be set on the `QueryRequest` by the caller not by this class if needed.
❗️ We should have good JavaDoc here to clearly explain how the class works what all the different parameters are how they can be used and how the different `Query` attributes (e.g. `pageSize` `startIndex` etc.) affect them.
❗️ We need to update the query's start index before calling the catalog otherwise we will always get the same results over and over again. We also need to make sure our unit tests catch this.
❗️ We should remove this constructor to make sure a message and/or cause is always provided.
❗️ I don't think we want to query for the next batch every time. Only when we know we've reached the end of the current batch.
❗️ We need JavaDoc here to describe what the parameters mean.\❓ If `maxResults` represents the page size couldn't we use `queryRequest.getQuery().getPageSize()` and not have this parameter? Same question for `startIndex`.
❗️ We need to update this description.
❗️ We shouldn't need the `isDone` flag anymore.
❗️ We should use `Integer.MAX_VALUE` for `endIndex` and `ceilingIndex`.
✏️  Don't think we need this.
❓ Is `maxResults` the number of results we want returned when we call `nextPage()`? If so should we call it `pageSize` instead?
❓ Since this is more than a filter should we use `query to use` or something similar?
❗️ We should use `QueryRequest` instead of `QueryRequestImpl` here and as arguments if we can.
❓ If we validate these should we consider validating _all_ arguments?
✏️  Not needed if we document the constructor arguments and/or class properly.
❓ Assuming `ceilingIndex` represents the maximum total number or results to return I wonder if we really need it. Since the client can provide start and end indices they can limit the total number of results they can get i.e. `ceilingIndex` = end inde
✏️  Should we use the argument types `CatalogFramework` and `QueryRequest` instead of the argument names? If we keep the argument names we should be consistent with the capitalization.
❓ Can we use `QueryRequest` instead of `QueryRequestImpl`?

✏️ Looks like this file needs to be reformatted.
✏️  Since this method does a GET and to be consistent with the other method name should we call it `getOpenSearch`?
❓ Should we make this method return a `ValidatableResponse` as well? Of maybe have the other one return a simple `Response`?
❗️ Since this method is called `AsXml` shouldn't it set the format to `xml` instead of taking it in as a parameter?
❗️ We should add JavaDoc to those methods to explain what they do and how to use them.
❓  I wonder if we really need both methods. We could keep only the first one and have callers pass in the format as `xml` and `count=100` where needed.
easy to fix ☝️ 
✏️ Probably best to wrap the loop in a `LOGGER.isDebugEnabled()` block then. It'll be more efficient and clarify intent of the loop.
❓ It looks like both `safeKey` and `id` can be null here and while you're testing if `safeKey` is null later in the method it looks like the `id` can be null and not tested on line 205. That may not be the case but that's how it's reading to me.
❗️ Also the check on `safeKey` and deletion from the `fileIdMap` should occur outside this loop.
❗️ Should close the output stream.
✏️ You could initialize this directly but you'd still need an if test if it were false. It's a wash.
✏️ Might want to add serialization tests.
❗️ I wouldn't use the `hashCode()` of the `refKey` here; there are too many collisions with Java hash codes. While more expensive to generate you should generate a SHA-1 hash (the collisions rate there is minuscule).
✏️ Since you're wrapping an `IOException` maybe throw the more specific `UncheckedIOException`.
❗️ Should be `setETag`.
❓ You're never deleting the temp directory?
✏️ Might consider adding serialization tests.
❓ I've tried to read this loop several times and it's still not clear to me. Part of that is not having a good understanding of the sardine library but mostly it's just straight up confusion. If that's the case for me I suspect it will be for others as w

✏️ Could call `dav.toFile()` here instead.
❓ Is this really a warn and continue situation or should it be a failure condition? What happens if you create your exchange with a `GenericFile` that doesn't have a valid canonical path set?
✏️ I don't personally mind the ternary in this case but there are some who would find this particular use a bit too C-like.
✏️ My strong preference is to separate the form/structure of streaming code from the internal complexity. I'm not opposed to one-liner lambdas but anything more than that makes the stream hard to read. I'd extract the guts of this out to a method.

✏️ Look at [Apache's `StringUtils.repeat()`](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.html#repeat-java.lang.String-int-) method.

❓ I believe this is the only place where you close the file (implicitly with the `deleteQuietly`) so in the case where there are metacards exported you'll leave it open. Might be best to use try-with-resources or wrap in a try/finally.

❓ If this is a rename operation shouldn't we call `moveFile()` here or delete the source file on completion? Or should this method be renamed to `copyFile()`?
❓ Is this worth a log?
❗️ This logger statement is wrong. It will `toString()` the stream returned from the `map` method. To match above you want to get `createdMetacards.get(0).getId()`. Conversely \```java\createMetacards.stream()\    .map(Metacard::getId)\    .findFirs
❗️ Same. This will `toString()` your stream.
✏️ We do have a `cxf.xalan.bundle.version` property in the root pom.
✏️ Nit. You might want to move the `rootEntry` down so the non-serialized and serialized fields in the class are all grouped together.
❓ Shouldn't this also be the SHA-1 of the filename?
❗️ Same problem with `toString`
❓ Why just the first metacard in the list? Should we protect against null or empty `createdMetacards`?
✏️ Overall this is a _slightly_ more efficient version of this method:\```java\    private Set<String> getHiddenFields(List<Result> metacards) {\        List<Predicate<String>> hiddenFieldPatterns = configuration.getHiddenAttributes()\

❓ There are still two references to the `org.ops4j.pax.web.extender.whiteboard` package in DDF both for the `DefaultResourceMapping` class. Should those have been updated to this new package as well?
❓ Some of the refactoring I mentioned above could also clean up this code down here. We shouldn't need to do the same construction validation and logging in multiple places.
❓ Does this really belong here if it's only used by the component test? Or is it the start of greater things to come? ???? 
❓ Do you really need this file?

❓ Should we test the `PrivilegedActionException` in `updatePasswords`? If that exception isn't properly handled couldn't we end up with a vulnerability?
❓ Can we use a better name than `function` here e.g. `passwordTransform` maybe?
❓ Do we really need to override the `findbugs` configuration here and turn it off? If so may want to add a comment as to why we're doing it.
✏️  Should be able to replace those two lines with `StringUtils.substringBeforeLast(pid \".\")`.

✏️ If you add a filter here - `\"(id=*)\"` - then you can simplify your processing below and not check for a null id. The filter will only return those `InputTransformer`s that have an id.
✏️ You can make the ctor for `TransformerProperties` smarter passing in the `ServiceReference` and letting it extract the fields it needs. Then you can replace this loop with something simpler like...\```java\List<TransformerProperties> transformersPro

❓ Is this introducing tech debt we'll want to pay down then? Have you created tickets to address that?
✏️ I don't love these direct accesses to the protected params field. My preference - just a preference - would be to access them through the public `getParameters()` method of the super class.
✏️ 1. Favor `String.format()` over concatenation.\2. I think this is probably a complex enough lambda that it distracts from the form of the stream logic. It would read better if you extracted a method to convert the `sortKey` to this String representati
✏️ Instead of duplicating this line could you move it up to the declaration of `not`?
❓ Is there value in leaving this `author` tag especially as it is a defunct email address?
❓ Just trace? Is this just something that will really never happen and if it does an admin will want to explicitly turn up logging on this class to figure out why?
❓ Is there a reason you're constructing this and the `COMPARISON_OPERATORS` list so differently?\1. Set vs. List\2. Explicitly adding enums to an interim `EnumSet` vs. `enumclass.values()`?
❓ Is this an ever-growing/dynamic list? Would it be possible to change from `String` to an enum?
❓ This feels very fragile/brittle.
❗️ These semantics are not the same as the `equals()` semantics of the super class. This could lead to some very strange conditions in collections or other cases.\\Realistically it is unlikely to happen or it would be happening already with the extant 
✏️ Likewise with these returns could you just remove from here and have one below the `switch` statement?
❗️ Set coverage values to two decimal places (and then leave at least a .03 margin because of floating point inconsistencies).
❓ Worries about type cast errors?
❓ Is there a way to determine if the provided filter is a CQL filter without trying to convert it? I assume there isn't but if there is it would be preferable to the try/catch.
✏️ There's usually no reason to pre-size an `ArrayList` particularly when it is going to be short but it obviously doesn't hurt to do so.
❓ Why are we keeping this field?
❗️ Remove the reference count and use `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>` at the usage sites instead.
❓ Does this mean if we create an `AssetSource` while an unrelated OOP request is in process it could cause the unrelated request to fail?
❗️ Implementation of `IDisposable.Dispose()` must never be `abstract`. It needs to be implemented exactly like this:\\```csharp\public void Dispose()\{\  Dispose(true);\  GC.SuppressFinalize(this);\}\```
❗️ \"...users in the base...\"
❓ Did you mean to use back ticks here?
❗️ Should be \"field\" singular.
✏️ Should probably be clearer that the distinguished name is incorrectly formatted.\'The distinguished name has an invalid format.'
❗️ 'No groups were found containing any members.'
❗️ It's fine to move the initialization of this into the static block (though I'm not sure I see the advantage of it) but it should still be `final`.
✏️ Not exactly idempotent as it does force the underlying queue to be filled more on each call. You need a test to ensure that does not happen.
❗️ This call to `hasNext()` unless I'm mistaken will double-load the queue if the calling code invokes \```java\hasNext();\next();\```\in succession.
❗️ I can see no way that you can know the `Query` returned here is castable to a `QueryImpl`. Is there a reason you're not calling the `QueryRequestImpl` ctor that takes a `Query`?
❗️ It appears that there's nothing to protect against multiple calls to `hasNext()` without calls to `next` between them. For very large result sets this would allow bad/malicious code to eat up all memory resources by loading the entire result set into 
❗️ It's mildly bothersome that you've used the method name `clone` here as it implies different semantics and looks out of place operating on a different class instead of on itself. I would rename to something like `copy`.
❓ Do we really want to use max_int as a valid start index? I mean...it's _valid_ I suppose.
❗️ Again I'm not clear how you can know with any certainty that this is a `QueryImpl`. Although if your `clone/copy` method were to explicitly create a `QueryImpl` that might help.
❗️ This is going to create a new `ConcurrentHashMap` on each invocation. If the purpose of the map is to ensure uniqueness of the keys this won't work.\\I see that this code existed before; it is tech debt.\\You might consider changing the `contentIt

✏️  The name of this method is somewhat confusing. I was expecting it to set something on the object but it really just converts the `subjectDNConstraints` and returns a list of `Pattern`. Should we consider renaming it?
❗️ We should update the `SubjectDNConstraintsInterceptor.handleMessage()` comment.
❓ Assuming we make this method `private` can we replace the check on L56 with this one and get rid of this `if` statement? Or only have the check here return an empty `List` if the constraint is `null` or empty and have the calling code trigger on that 
✏️  Should we add `FromAllowedDn` to the name to clarify what this is testing?
✏️  Per our coding standards we should camel-case acronyms so the class variable parameters and method names should `Dn` instead of `DN`. Not a big deal if it's too much trouble to rename all of those.
❗️ Is there a reason for this to be `public`? Couldn't find any other class calling this method.
❗️ We need to test the case where the constraints are empty.
✏️  Rename to `testHandleMessageWithMultipleCommaPatternsFromAllowedDN` or something along those lines?
✏️  There's a lot of repeated setup code in this test class. We should consider extracting that code to a private method that takes parameters use JUnit parametrized tests or use Spock. Going with parametrized tests or Spock would help capture all the p

✏️ Since this is not a method that exists as part of the `Iterable` interface we should provide a comment that specifies what type of stream . Alternatively we could simply remove this method and let the client build a stream from the `iterator` themsel
❓ Also wonder if we shouldn't make this a little more specific and name it something like `CatalogQueryException` or something. @rzwiefel @coyotesqrl thoughts?

✏️  Should make this description a little more generic e.g. class that provides a way to iterate over individual catalog results?

✏️ If this was a javadoc the reference to catalog framework could be an `@link` instead.

✏️ It looks like we could validate non-null and make this field final.
❗️ This is dev docs/release notes worthy.
❓ why are these inline comments instead of javadoc comments? Personally I prefer the latter.
❓ Should we respect the page size here so that clients with a performance need could benefit from the optimization or provide an additional parameter for spliterator size?
❓ What is the point of the `queryResultPaginator`?\\This is still just an  inner class that takes the other class and embeds it inside of it. Why not just make this class contain all the logic instead of putting it elsewhere and just wrapping it.
✏️  We probably should make this package-private until we decide how clients do paging.
✏️  This can be made `final`.
❗️ This class still follows the iterator API almost exactly and yet does not implement iterator?
❗️ We should just hard-code `true` here instead of doing `!isResultsListEmpty`. Will make the expectation clearer.\This applies to the other tests as well.
❗️ We shouldn't need this method. Everything should be tested through the paginator mock and public API.
❗️ Instead of setting this here we probably want to mock the call to the paginator and look at the sequence of calls from the iterator and paginator point of view.

❓  Should we be announcing something to the user in this case?
❗️ We can't assume the `store` is what is being used so we should switch this to be calling the `selectionInterface`.  Otherwise it'll break or do strange things on other routes.

✏️ You should probably add some negative test paths as well where the nesting is incorrect to ensure you don't return those values.

These `memcpy`s should be fairly trivial to replace with `u8 buffer[] = _(\"▶$\")`; That should place the string in the `.rodata` section of the object file.

❗️ This looks like its going to alway send out a query -- purely to check if there's any more results. If the response already came back with 0 results (or our current index has reached the resultCount) then we should **know** there are non left to fetch 
❓ Since it doesn't look like the `Boolean` stored in the `registryStoreMap` was only used for this could we simplify the code a little by replacing the `Map` with a `Set` that contains the list of pids we know about?
❓ Should we inline this since the variable isn't used anywhere other than on L95?
✏️  Since this is now mentioned in the interface's JavaDoc we could remove this comment.
These classes should really have used Mockito to mock the `PersistenceStore` instead of hand-coding it ☹️

❓ Any chance this could be something else than a `String` here?
❓ Since this is a private method only used by `logicalOperator()` and `null` will be converted to an `UnsupportedOperationException` could we just throw that exception here instead? Would make the query building logic simpler in `logicalOperator()`.

❕ This form has reduced cognitive burden in cases where the computed values are start/end instead of start/length (applies to all three cases from this commit).

What about `PrintStringWithPalette(_(\"▶\") paletteNum left top);`?
Yes they should (didn't include all the arguments for some reason). ✅

❓ Is it worth making a test for the no details case? 
❓  There's one priority not here right? If someone uses that what will happen? 
❓  What's up with this nested try?
✏️  We log when the subject name is null but should we log anything if the id is empty? 
✏️  I just noticed there's a typo in the word \"System\" on all of these fields SYSYTEM 
✏️  I find it a little weird that below you have `SystemNotice.SYSYTEM_NOTICE_DETAILS_KEY + \"_txt\"` but here you have it inlined. 
You could do `PrintStringWithPalette(&(u8[])_(\"▶\"));` but that's a bit ugly and I think the way marijnvdwerf suggested is fine. Just rename `buffer` to something useful like `rightArrow`.

✏️  Should we be consistent and always use either `CatalogProvider` or `Catalog Provider` in this table?

✏️  Missing space.
✏️  Space misplaced?
✏️  Would _enforced_ or _applied_ work better than _implemented_ here?
❓ Pretty sure all the plugins have the same failure behavior. Could we just explain how they all work at the beginning instead of repeating this for each one?
❓ Would \"fail fast\" be a better term here?
❗️ This should be `ddf.catalog.content.plugin.PreCreateStoragePlugin`. It is also marked _Experimental_ so I don't know if we want to mention it here.
❗️ Looks like we're missing the `PreFederatedQueryPlugin` and `PostFederatedQueryPlugin`
❓ Any reason some of the code snippets are in `[source...]` blocks but others aren't?
❓ This one is in an `internal` package. Should we mention it?
❓  Do we have some information we can link to in the docs to show how to check for local vs. remote requests?

❓ _being added_ instead of _to be added_?
✏️  Since _Delivery Method_ is the name of an interface should we use `DeliveryMethod` instead? We could also be specific and write that the `created()` method will be called in the example.
✏️  Should we be consistent with _Delivery Method_ and either use the interface name (`DeliveryMethod`) or two capitalized words?
✏️  Remote _IP_ Address Remote Host _Name_?
✏️  If we have any documentation on how subscriptions are created (e.g. using CSW) we may want to refer to that section.
✏️  Missing a space between _The_ and _Event_.

❓ Should we mention this in the documentation as well?
✏️ We use `()` for `-cn` and `-dn` options in the docs but `[]` in the scripts themselves. Should we consistent and always use the same thing everywhere i.e. `[]` if they are optional or `()` if one of them is required?
❓ Should we extract the long `String.format()` to a `private` method to make the code more readable?
✏️ Remember to update the second parameter to `new String[] {}` instead of `null` if we can get rid of the `@Nullable` arguments.
❓ Can we use `<code>` inside a `<pre>` block? Won't that just show the `<code>` tag in the text? I also thought that `<pre>` already used the same mono-spaced font as `<code>`?
✏️ `IllegalArgumentException` instead of `RuntimeException`?
✏️ You could also use the `{@code}` marker inside the `<pre>`. That way you won't have to escape all the `<` and `>`: http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0623.html.
✏️ Don't think we need the `null` at the end of the method call here.
❓ Instead of setting this to `null` and have to use `@Nullable` and deal with `null` could we just set this to `new String[0]` instead?
❓ The tags are all case-sensitive right? We don't need to lowercase them or something?
Right. I don't like magic ✨  anyway.

and ya even fixed the indent! ❤️ \\but am I seeing things or did the same var get local tagged twice in the same scope here?
Thanks! ❤️ 
`Search with Google` is more specific and consistent with other context menus ✌️ 
❓ Since we need to set all three things at once could we have a single method like `dismissed(String dismissedBy)` and not have to call three different methods? This would make the `Alert` class a little more useful and ensure that everything gets set.
❓Any way we can avoid mentioning things like \"events\" and \"topic\" in these descriptions? Feels a little technical for some admins.
✏️ Nit: `if (id == null) { return; }` instead?
❓Should we provide a simple example for this one e.g. `for instance if the priority is set to 2 only Normal priority alerts and above will be sent`?
✏️ Use `Optional` instead of `null`?
❗️ If `hostname` is ever `null` this will potentially cause NPEs downstream so we may want to set it to a default value if we don't fail the bundle.
✏️ Stream instead of for each loop?
❓ Even though this really unlikely to happen should we put this code in an `init()` method instead and fail the bundle if it does happen?
❓ Will using this method as the sole synchronization mechanism to keep alerts consistent in the persistent store always be enough? Should we use some kind of optimistic locking mechanism in the `PersistenceStore` class instead to make sure that if code ge
❓ Should we log something if there's more than 1 alert in the list?
❓ Shouldn't we still call `awaitTermination` here just in case there's an event being processed when `destroy()` is called?
❗️ Don't need to `if` check here since the `for` loop will just short-circuit if `results` is empty.
✏️ Typo: _when_ twice
✏️ An example here might be useful. Should we also format the mappings a little different e.g. `Possible values: 4 (Critical) 3 (Important) 2 (Normal) or 1 (Low)`?
✏️ Should we include a section somewhere to explain what Decanter is and provide some reference links maybe?
❗️ If we keep these constants we need to clearly document what they mean what they're used for if they have any constraints which ones are used as part of the unique identifier etc.
❓ I know we're following the same pattern used for other notifications here but would it be possible to _not_ extend from `HashMap` and just have these classes _contain_ a `Map`? That would allow us to not have all those constants and prevent client code
❓ Should we consider not mentioning events and topics in the administration section and keep that information for the integration and/or developing sections instead? Would it make sense to only talk about alerts how they get dismissed why they are resen

@t-sauer ⬆️ What do you think?
Nice Doxygen inline comments ❤️ 
⭕️ Your summit talk had some nice graphics explaning these benefits. I think they could help here too.
⭕️ I personally don't like these kinds of comments that just state the obvious. They often just make the code harder to follow. 
⭕️ remove \"Typically\"
⭕️ I'd leave out \"fast\" that's already implied by \"concurrent\"
⭕️ The examples might be a little long for release notes. Maybe just refer to the reference documentation/samples?
⭕️ We should use some property of the created output here to make it clear that you would only wait if you need to do some work on the output that the workers created. Otherwise you could have just submitted another work item.
⭕️ Intra-project is a term that would need explanation. I'd just say \"parallel execution of multiple tasks\"
⭕️ \"we can maximize the resources available\"? You mean \"we can fully utilize the available resources\"?
⭕️  I'd use constructor injection it's a less confusing pattern. Most plugins don't need their tasks to be extensible so the getter-based approach will have no clear advantage for them.
❗️ Please move this field down so it's not in the middle of your statics. You might also want to move all the static fields up above the shared fields.

❗️ These should be JavaDoc style comments i.e. `/** Description */` since they need to show up in the generated HTML.

❓ Since this is auto-generated should we even have this setter?

❗️Should use JavaDoc-style comments.
❓ Can't we just do `new Date()` instead of `Date.from(Instant.now())`?
❗️ `null` check? Should we also check for `null` or empty entries?
❓ Any special expectations for details? Will they be used for display purposes? Why a collection instead of a simple `String`?
❓ Couldn't we store the enum constants directly instead of their values?
❓Should we allow clients to change the host name and IP address properties?
✏️ @ricklarsen do we have a standard for title capitalization? Should we capitalize the first letter of each word in titles?
❓ I wonder how much control we should give the admins here and if we need to expose those configurations as a metatype? @pklinef thoughts?
✏️ _and_ repeated twice.
❓ Any specific reason we're putting this in `libs` instead of `platform`?
❗️ Shouldn't we check for `null` or empty here and fail if that's the case?
✏️ Might be clearer to extract the encoded `GeneralName` to a constant.
✏️ Our convention is to camel-case acronyms so `DN` should be `Dn` `SAN` should be `San` etc.
✏️ Not a big deal but we should try to follow the given/when/then structure and keep the `csr.addSubjectAlternativeNames()` together first and the `assertThat()` together after.
✏️ We usually put the `@Before` `@Test` and `@After` methods first so people don't have to search for them and keep the `private` methods at the bottom of the class.
❓ Can't we use `assertThat` here?
❗️ We should have a separate test to check that `getKeyStoreFile()` does the right thing and not have these repeated assertions in all the methods.
❗️ Tests should be first.
❓ Can't we use `assertThat` here?

❗️We should avoid the `-1` here and provide a page size that makes sense in the context of this method e.g. something like 250 and create a constant for it.

❗️We don't need this annotation here. I didn't know about this one though. Interesting one.
❗️ Same comment as above i.e. replace `0` with a constant set to 250.

❓ We've programmed `responseMock.getResults()` to return 2 lists of 100 results then an empty one. Shouldn't we be expecting 200 results from the `getMetacardsByFilter()`?\✏️ We could use `assertThat(expected hasSize(numResults));` instead and not need

✏️ Instead of mocking the `CatalogFramework` and all the calls the `ResultIterator` makes to it we could mock the `ResultIterator` directly using a `BiFunction<CatalogFramework QueryRequest ResultIterable>` or a factory method (see https://confluence.

❓ Now that we've encapsulated the properties map inside this class does any client need direct access to the map's keys and values or can they all use this class' API? If nothing needs direct access to the keys and values we should consider removing al
❓ Since this method takes care of updating 3 other properties do we need the 3 other setters? Couldn't that put the object in an invalid state e.g. marked as not dismissed but has a dismissed time and user?
❓ Should we wait until we know that the items have been successfully persisted before emptying the queue?
❓ These are fairly advanced configurations that I doubt admins will ever need to change. Should we just use undocumented system properties for now instead of exposing those in the configuration admin? @pklinef thoughts?
❗️ Same comments as the ones made on the `SystemNotice` class (constants `@Nullable` values etc.). Looks like this class cannot be immutable though since it can be dismissed.
❓ Could we return `Collections.unmodifiableMap(properties)` instead of returning a copy or will that break the eventing framework? If we need to return a copy should we add a comment to that effect?
❓ Should we consider passing the `Event` to the `Alert` and let it extract what it needs?
❓ Should we consider adding some retry logic here using failsafe?
❓ Can we make this class immutable since it can all be initialized by the constructors? If not are we sure we want _all_ of the properties to be mutable?\❗️ Do we really need to allow some of the values to be `null`? If so we should add the `@Nullable` 
❓ Could we loop over the map entries returned by `Alert.getProperties()` and not have to worry about all the constants and adding every single property one by one? Another option could be to move the `SystemNotice` and `Alert` classes in the `platform` la

⭕️ Part of this concatenation could be moved to the `Scalars` class using some kind of `describeTo(StringBuilder)` method.

Ref: #33  ✔️
Ref: #34 ✔️
✏️ I'm not sure I see the advantage of pulling the logic to get the configuration up to here instead of just passing the `configurationEvent` down to the `handleUpdate` method. The same applies to your private `handleDelete` method and the necessity of ex
✏️ My assumption is that the OSGi implementation is going to handle `SynchronousConfigurationListener`s in a _synchronous_ fashion but that doesn't necessarily imply it won't concurrently invoke them. Your `pidFileMap` is definitely not thread-safe.\\U
✏️ If you know what other operations you're going to be adding to this interface it might be best to include them in the interface now with stubbed out methods in the implementation class that throw `UnsupportedOperationException` for the time being.
❓ Is there value in logging this or is it a common case?
✏️ I would probably wrap this stream in an `ifDebugEnabled` test.
✏️ In these three log messages it would be good to include the pid I think.
❓ Is this correct? Do we want to be able to support managing config files directly in the `/etc` directory?
❗️ You should move this test above the call to `filePropChanged`. There's no reason to invoke that method if these values are both null.
❗️ Use variable interpolation instead of concatenation.
✏️ Should log the `felixConfigFileName` that failed to assist in debugging. Unless the two exceptions will always include the failed name.
✏️ I believe this line is erroneous.
✏️ I would rather we not use such _pretty_ numbers prone to fencepost errors. I think this test would be more clear if you had numbers that did not evenly divide into one another.
????‍♂️ yes good catch
❗️ Not a fan of logging at warn level to check debug traces to understand what failed.
✏️ I think you need more comments to explain this test. I fundamentally don't understand it. The `delete` method is invoked six times? Why is it six and not four? Why do you return the `metacardMockList` three times followed by an empty list? Shouldn't it
It's not guaranteed that `HM.keys` and `HM.elems` return keys/values in the same order. I am not sure if we can rely on it. @pva701 used a safer approach (`map snd . HM.toList` `map fst . HM.toList`).\Maybe it's too paranoid ????‍♂️ 
????‍♀️ This was causing tslint to bug me about prefixing my selectors w/ `app-`. I think because of the global namespace that selectors live in?
❓ Do you need to keep this method and `getFilterName` since this delegates to that and both are private?
✏️ You can invert this condition to reduce cyclomatic complexity.
❗️ Concur with Sonarqube.
❓ This is going to change infrequently? I recognize that on initialization it's going to update multiple times for each `SecurityFilter` but after that period of chaos is over the will be relatively stable?
❗️ To rephrase Sonarqube...use variable interpolation instead of concatenation for your log message.
✏️ I would recommend refactoring lines 137-144 into a method which you could then also use for the block of code from 168-175.
❓ What's getting thrown?
\"the\" ➡️ \"a\"
\"definition ... is defined\" is redundant.  \"defined\" ➡️ \"located\"?
\"a development branch ... should\" ➡️ \"a long-lived integration branch ... can\".

❓ Instead of \"previous paragraphs\" link to the section which describes this.
❓ \"an NGINX task named `foo/bar`\\or at least some rewording as this doesn't flow

❓ In Python you can ad a generator expression as a function argument e.g.\\`canvas.draw(Pixel(p fill_char) for p in self._internal_points())`\\Which would avoid allocating to an intermediate `pixels` list.
❓ How about we add a `IShape` interface with `Outline` and `Fill` methods?\\Then we'd only need a single `Square` implementation. \The line shapes would return zero pixels for `Fill`.
❓ I can't make up my mind whether it should be:\ * `IShape.Render(canvas)` or\ * `Canvas.Render(IShape)`\\And I don't know if the Shape object  should have a reference to it's outline and fill chars.\It'd be nice to be able to do e.g. dotted and dash

✏️ Using the single layer of abstraction principle perhaps pull the `NumberUtils....` section into a separate method to better describe how/why this maxPageSize is being set to what it's being set to.
✏️ Perhaps some JavaDoc comments above this test briefly explaining what is being tested and what the inputs mean.
✏️ Often it helps to place an `expected` string at the start of the unit test and avoid constructing a string inside the assert statement (construct to its own local variable in the line above it might be a bit clearer).
✏️ A more descriptive method name would be beneficial here for future developers curious about how this is functioning.
✏️ Perhaps clarify this comment a bit to something more like \"Populate list of mock results sized at max resource limit\" to help readers know the purpose of the lists.
❓ Why is this limit set to double the maxPageSize? Could this be any value or is 2 special? Something to include in the JavaDoc to explain the methodology of this test.
❗️ We shouldn't be throwing IllegalArgumentException. For one it is not documented as part of the contract which might be causing problems for those using the persistence strategy. Second it is inconsistent with Felix's implementation.
❗️ Chars are not supported by the Felix cfg format. So the test should actually validate that a string would be returned.
❓ Should we really be testing what the ConfigurationHandler from Felix does support? If they add some additional supports will we have to add more tests? They currently support arrays and we don't test below (not that we should).
✏️  We should add a note about the fact that the stream will not be closed automatically.
❗️ Ints are not supported by the Felix cfg format. So the test should actually validate that a string would be returned.
❗️ This is inconsistent with the .cfg format. Everything is serialized using the toString().
❗️ Why are we doing this? This is inconsistent with how Felix handles these files?
✏️  We should add a note about the fact that the stream will not be closed automatically.
❗️ Felix .cfg format doesn't support anything else than strings. Everything is converted to strings and read back as strings. We shouldn't introduce support like this.
❗️ Booleans are not supported by the Felix cfg format. So the test should actually validate that a string would be returned.
❓ Link to this?

❓ Shouldn't we catch `QueryResultException` here and pass the cause as a parameter to the `CswException`?
❓ Can you think of a reason we wouldn't be able to add copy constructors on the `QueryImpl` and `QueryRequestImpl` classes? We keep repeating those lines over and over again :-(
❓ Deleting metacards 20 at a time seems a little sub-optimal. Should we either increase `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE` or provide the page size parameter to the `setQueryPageSIze()` and give a higher number here?

Ah probably `pmap()` or `map()` on `drive_resource` would be better. ⚠️ you are going to see `split()` a few times since I tried to stay somewhat consistent but I will systematically change those on my next push.
❗️ We should put a comment here to explain why we're doing this.
✏️  Coverage could be higher on the OpenSearchFilterVisitor methods for dealing with `And` `Or` `Not` etc
✏️  Some documentation about what this is a Map of (query parameter to search string?) would be appreciated
✏️  A link/ref to `QueryRequest` might be useful. Helps clarify to the person reading the doc.
❓ Since we're using default values for everything except total results count and page size any reason we changed the way we create the `QueryImpl()`? Also we wouldn't need all the new constants if we were to keep things the way they were.
❗️ We should change the success and error messages. Since the number of IDs could be huge if the filter is very broad printing out all of them is probably not a good idea. We could only keep track of the number of metacards deleted instead and only repor

❗️ We need a description here similar to the one we had on the `ResultListIterable` class.
❓ Should we consider adding a `listIterator` that takes in a `maxResultCount` while we're at it?
❓ What do we gain by replacing all the constructors with static factory methods? If we make this change we will impact all the paging PRs that have been merged and are being worked so we want to make sure there's an advantage.
✏️  Nit: you can use `{@code blah}` instead of `<code>blah</code>`.
❓ Should we specify (here and everywhere version is used) what the format is for version e.g. \"X.Y\"?
❓ Given the number of interfaces we have in this API bundle do you think we should consider splitting them up between those to be used vs. the ones the framework expect to be implemented? Maybe have different sub-packages or notes in the comments?
I know they're the same....it's just better style to do it the other way. ☺️

❌ I think this is not exactly the same as what would have happened if we actually snapshotted the outputs. There are three differences:\- If the output property is a regular file then we would have only called `visitFileSnapshot`\- If the output proper
❌ When snapshotting the outputs the root directory will be part of the file system mirror (`putFile`). If we run the code here it won't. I think we should add the root directory to the file system mirror too.
❌ This is not correct. Currently if there is only one Java source file then this would be the only file in `destinationDir` for Java compilation. This would meant that we would register one class file in the destination directory a file snapshot but we w

FWIW I think we should just always `ember build -prod` here instead of checking that `dist` exists.  This same script exists in glimmer-vm and I have published old builds at least 5 times ????‍♂️ .
Well that's annoying. Oh well seems to light up fine in TS so ????‍♂️ 
❓ should this drive any documentation changes or would auto-generating the blueprint be sufficient?

✏️ If you add a second `vmOption` for the minheap (`-Xms`) and set it to at least `2G`/`2048M` you'll probably see an improvement in startup and overall runtime for the configuration tests. If you set it initially to 4G you'd get no memory thrashing at 
✏️ This should be removed.
✏️ It doesn't matter that much whether you add the call to `parallel` here or above but from a review perspective it's better to put it immediately after `.stream()` so people can see that this invocation is parallelized.
❓ These other `*settings()` methods other than `config()` it looks like they could be `protected` instead of `public`. Am I missing something?
❓ Why this change? Both versions are right and have comparable performance.
❓ Should we do any kind of validation here? Would it be possible for someone to do something malicious with this?
✏️ Maybe capitalize Confluence everywhere in this blueprint
✏️  Might consider changing \"get\" to \"pop\" to indicate the side-effect of returning top value as well as removing it. A get is more passive and doesn't remove any elements which may be what future developers might assume when using this method.
✏️  Strings for assert reasons could be cleaned up a bit and constructed up where the input variables are declared. \"expected\" strings declared with variables.
Should we show https://github.com/infinitered/reduxsauce ? ☺️ 
❓ Can collapsing bins be tested at the unit test level?
✏️ It seems we can make this something like `public void bootFeature()` that will just set it to true and have it be false by default.
❗️ Synchronizing the methods won't help here as the monitor needs to be acquired on the `queryFilterTransformerMap` object not `this`.\\I guess the real question is this. Is it a problem if `CswQueryFactory` calls `getTransformer()` while `bind` or `un
❓ Should we call this something like `getQueryRequest` instead? A `set` method that returns a value is a little counterintuitive.
✏️  We could use `Optional.map()` here if `getTransformer()` returned an `Optional` instead of `null` ;-)
✏️  May want to call this `LOGGER` to be consistent with the rest of our code.
❓ Do we expect the admin to be able to do something about this? If not error is probably too high (see https://codice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DDF/pages/7045131/Log+Levels).
❓ Should we use `isEnterprise` instead of `isDistributed` to be consistent with the `Federatable` and `QueryRequest` interfaces and other Catalog Framework classes?
❓ It looks like for a cache query we want to set `isEnterprise` to true will this conflict with that?\https://github.com/codice/ddf/blob/9939ef34e50441223d9114ef4c320a97f840106c/catalog/ui/catalog-ui-search/src/main/java/org/codice/ddf/catalog/ui/query/

❗️ These imports seem also to have been expanded beyond that which was intended.
❗️ Seems like the formatter still got these. I see no imports between these region tags.
❓ Could we initialize the `results` first and pass that in to the `QueryResponseImpl` constructor instead of giving an empty `ArrayList` and then populating it? Might make the code a little more straightforward.
❓Just to make sure here. `popNextResponse()` will be called when the mock is setup not when the test is run and `framework.query()` is called. Is that what we want?
✏️ Formatting is off here.
❓ Shouldn't we have more tests here i.e. one when we reach the total number of hits one when we reach the number requested and one we reach the hard-coded limit (`1000`)?
❗️Since this is a test class we shouldn't worry about catching exceptions here and just let the exceptions (which will never happen) bubble up. Adding `throws Exception` to the method should be good enough here.
Ha... Need more ☕️ 
✏️ A comment here would be nice to explain these magic numbers. Also should you include an `else` condition?

❓ Any specific reasons we use `Atomic` objects here? Those are local variables and afaict they aren't updated by multiple threads.
❓ Shouldn't we catch `CatalogQueryException` here as well?
❓ Should we increase our page and batch sizes here and above? I don't know what @kcwire thinks but `64` seems like a fairly low number. We usually use something in the `250` - `1000` range.
✏️  `batchCount` instead of `batch` if we keep the in-out parameters?
✏️  Should we rename `batch` to `batchCount` or `batchNumber` to make it clear that this is _not_ the batch of results?
❓ Instead of using `Atomic` objects so we're able to pass them as in-out parameters below could we use primitives increment `batch` in the `for` loop and have `updateResultList` return the actual updated count and add that number to `updatedCount`? Just
❓ Any reason we're using `totalHits` instead of just always use `resultList.size()` which is always guaranteed to be set and accurate?

✏️  `importDirectoryArgument`?

✏️  `{@code ...}` instead of `<code>...</code>`?
✏️  Having to wrap the `Consumer` in an `Optional` when calling `doExport` is a little awkward (see my comment below on the `ConfigurationMigrationService` interface).
❓ Should we wait until those functions have been moved to a common module and officially reviewed outside this PR before exporting them?
✏️  Remove _and data_ from the description.
❗️ Don't forget to rework these tests.
❓ Do we want to print what `e.toString()` returns here (and below) or should we print `e.getMessage()`?
❓ Do we need to mention the `Migratable` services as part of the command description? Feels like an implementation detail for the admin using the command.

❓ `baseName` instead of `bname`?
❓ Do we still need to address this TODO as part of this PR? If not we should remove it.
❓ Any reason we create a constant for `VERSION` but not for the other fields?\❓ Should we consider having a base class that takes that information in and provides default implementations for all those methods (version id description organization)?

❓ Why a LinkedList?
❓ Do we want to core-apis team to be so broad?  I could see focusing on API projects like `catalog/core/catalog-core-api` instead of all of `catalog/core`.  But I could also see catalog-core-standardframework being included which blurs the line.
Could we use the `©` sign?

❗️ We need to be setting the correct http status codes on the response when we return errors for many of the places in here.
❗️ I think we do want to request the total result count.
Stability of the export formats should be mentioned:\\* XML: ☑️ \* CSV: ???? \\Of course phrasing should not be limited to an emoji.
❗️ I believe this needs a `CreateItem` down below (~line 112)
Since every one of these makes it more difficult for users to reason about the impact of seemingly non-breaking changes to the \"internal\" API I have a few questions:\\❓ What are these two assemblies?\❓ Why are these two assemblies not part of this rep
❓ Why not pass `context` for consistency with the cases above?
✏️  It seems like this will not ever be used on export (right now it's not). We should probably move this down into the `ImportMigrationContextImpl`.
✏️  Could we name this more explicitly like \"systemPropertyEntries\"?
✏️  I don't think this class should have reference to this field. From an object-oriented standpoint it muddies the waters (and confuses me at first glance) to have a field that is really based on the field of its embedded migratable. Obviously this wil
❓  Why do we not call `runCodes()` here and in `wasIOSuccessful()`? Maybe we should make that clear in the javadoc because I could see a user assuming this method will still execute the code they've registered previously in addition to the passed in `Runn
✏️  I think we should come up with more specific and explicit names for the various versions we're maintaining. It's confusing that there's a `VERSION` field on this class that has different meaning than the `getVersion()` method on this class. Perhaps we
✏️  Is this method required by any of our migratables? It seems like enough control is provided by the store method that takes a consumer and that this method could be a private utility method on the impl. In fact the only usage of this method I can find
✏️  \"... as many issues...\"
✏️  Does the provided predicate run its validation on the entry if the entry already exists? If so does it still return an empty Optional if the validation fails? I think it should be clarified what the validation behavior is when the entry already exist
✏️  I think we should probably specify what \"All others\" means here. Like \"All other interfaces in this package\".
✏️  Not sure if we decided we are going to keep this. If we are I think a more self-explanatory name would be very helpful here. EBiConsumer is very confusing. Maybe \"ExceptionBiConsumer\" or \"ExceptionalBiConsumer\"?
✏️  Same comment as with EBiConsumer.
✏️  static-import `Mockito.mock`? Could also use the `@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)` and `@Mock` annotation.
❓ Can we use static imports and remove all those `Mockito.` in front of the mockito calls? It kind of gets in the way of Mockito's easy to read DSL and makes the code noisier than it could be.
❓ I know we did have some documentation related to the previous API but I wonder if we should keep doing that. @ricklarsen do you think we should refer to the JavaDoc instead of repeating most of what's there already and risk this section to become out-
✏️  We could also use `verifyZeroInteractions(service);`
✏️  We try to use `setup()` as a convention (https://codice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DDF/pages/6291523/Unit+Testing) for the `@Before` methods.

The other way to do this is with a callback on 'create' for the contribution—but I *much* prefer this approach of directly making the call to email where we want it sent because it's much easier to follow and test because it's more predictable ✨ 
Use of `random_pet` to generate names and proper leveraging of `element()` has resulted in a single-file terraform configuration! (Excluding `variables.tf` and `outputs.tf` that is.)\\✅ 
Update: A single-file Terraform configuration has been achieved; `random_shuffle` while cool and fun and interesting doesn't provide any added value here. I've refactored to use `element()` again which has modulus built-in.\\✅

❗️ Use classes instead of IDs.  Even if we expect the component to only be shown once this approach will fail if another component defines the same ID (our code or third party).

❓ Do we want to make it clear this is really only for internal use?  If so then we should consider moving this to `/internal/session`.
❗️ We should not be logging messages that refer to migratables (for this one or the export message on the line above). This is very implementation specific and is going to be confusing to the admin. We are already logging similar messages for us for debug

❓ Do we really need all those constructors to be `public`?

✏️  Remember to add all the comments we talked about to make sure all the felix version and code we copied line up when karaf is upgraded.

❌ Why did this test change?
❌ We generally don't say \"your Gradle\" but just \"Gradle\".
❌ This should not change it is unrelated to the deprecation.
❌ This is a public type we should keep the API surface minimal. Instead this logic belongs into the class that does the actual deprecation check.
❌ We shouldn't add internal methods to the public API.
❌ We should test this like all other cases not with the indirection through a script. I guess you did this because it was the only way to see the deprecation message. But that just means a user would never see it. So instead of adjusting the test we nee

⭕️ This is now unused. You probably want to adjust it to match the message in `UnsupportedVersionConnection` and use it in `ToolingApiUnsupportedProviderCrossVersionSpec`
⭕️ I'd probably call this `Specification` instead of `Support`. That explains the intent of the class better.
❌ This cannot work. Should be `!=`. If the tests passed with this then they are not working.
⭕️ Can you adjust this message to sound more like the one in `UnsupportedOlderVersionConnection`? It provides the user with a little more detail and a more actionable description of what to do about it.
⭕️ You can avoid `output.toString()` by having a `getOutput` method that returns a String.
❌  Why are we inlining the `PotentialConflict` here? That seems like a too eager optimization.

❓ Any specific reason we're not using the default timeout?
❓ Can we make this `private static final int BATCH_SIZE = 250`?
❓I'm pretty sure this won't be a problem but we should confirm that this stream will not force all the metacards to be loaded and held in memory at any given time since that could cause `OutOfMemoryError`.

⭕️ This table doesn't add any information that's not already in the sentence above. I think we can remove it.
❌ This sentence is confusing because of a grammatical issue: \"which you should avoid using\" comes after \"Gradle 5.0\" which means that I shouldn't use Gradle 5.0. That's not the message we want.\\I'd just remove that last part of the sentence. It is obv

❓ What does this do for resx files with the code generation option set to None? For example [this VSPackage.resx](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/LangSvcV2/blob/79d7b636f1dd5bbf175f3a66c6cb31edb3060f5b/Tvl.VisualStudio.Language.Antlr3/Tvl.VisualStudi
⚠️ There are many other generated source files which match this pattern including Windows Forms.
❓ Should this be conditioned on `EnableDefaultEmbeddedResourceItems` as well? Or perhaps some other property?
`DEFAULT_LOCALE` not expected to exist ✔️ 
????‍♂️ \\i fatfingered that. i meant `\"failed to set up sources from the following URLs:\\n\"` - sorry!
It could but then you can't use that class as a component [here](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-drive/pull/394/files#diff-ccfb11fef287f9616f7aa1a57b1209a5R55) ????‍♂️ 
Should be at the beginning of `createClientApi` as `wrapSpace` and `wrapOrganizationCollection`.\\I can give it a try? ????‍♂️ 
its weird we don't set `misc=true` on any of the StaticCategory declarations but rely on the bit of code below that does it based on slug.  ????‍♂️ 
Same as above ☝️ 
❗️ \IIUC this is significantly changing the API contract violating the design we agreed on in wiki and IMO adding more friction to app development \\before:\\```ts\this.controllers = [ProductController CategoryController];\```\\after:\\```ts
❓ It doesn't really matter since it's just a unit test/sample but should this be summing the `totalResults` from each element instead of taking the last value?
✅ there was some edge case (or what looked like it) handling of quotes and prefix mangling happening here; still trying to keep track of the reasons for the 3-4 extra helper functions in `id.go` before I delete them. 
Hooray for code review!  Fixup ⬇️ 
✏️ Nit: `new String[0]` would actually be faster than `new String[id.size()]`
✏️ Nit: Could remove mention of metacard IDs as it is redundant.
✏️ Nit: Could be rewritten as \"No IDs or filter detected\"
✏️  you could use slf4j parameterized logging for `ids` on this logger statement: https://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#logging_performance
SOLUTION: Instead of `recognize` taking 2 params it should take 1\\That way people can...\\```ruby\recognize content: audio_file encoding: :LINEAR16 sample_rate_hertz: 16000 language_code: \"en-US\"\```\\Currently you have to do this ☹️ \\``
## ⚠️  Video uses `input_uri` and `input_content` but Speech uses `content` or `uri`
## ❗️ ACTUALLY.... \\`content:` or `uri:` don't fit in very well with `encoding:` `sample_rate_hertz:` etc...\\And Video uses different `input_content:` and `input_uri:`\\Could the named params be consistent???\\I'm OK with the named params being 
✏️ Use parameter interpolation for logging.
❓ Are we using the total results count somewhere? If not we don't need to set this to `true`.
❗️For the new tests we may want to capture the parameter being passed to `delete` using an `ArgumentCaptor` and at least make sure we're calling the catalog framework with the right number of IDs.
❗️We should add one test where the filter returns no IDs (e.g. `configureMocks(0)`).\❗️We should also have a test where both a list of IDs and a filter are provided.
✏️  How about _No document IDs or filter provided._ ?
✏️  Typo: Extra _s_ between _ID_ and _(s)_
❓ Do we need this `if` here since we already check that the list of IDs is not empty in `executeWithSubject()`?
❓ Are all of these executables directly affected? Or is one more so than others?\\It seems like **csi.exe** could be priority 2 and it's possible that **VBCSCompiler.exe** is actually the only one that needs to be priority 1.
One last request -- how about a ☃ for good measure?
❓ Do you still need to have that colon bit on the end of the constant? 
yeah we didn't actually update this but the repo had changes that weren't published for this package.  We could remove this change all together ????‍♂️ 
❓ Is there another mechanism in place to eliminate the need to alert the user using this approach?
❓ Do you still need the `throws IOException` on the method with this catch? 
Are we not using this selector anymore? Should we just ✂️ it?
TBH we don't need pointers at all; they were just my solution to checking whether to add a field to the input but with two separate update functions actual values are what we want.\\✅
Oop thanks :forehead_slap:\\✅ 
❓ There should be a call to `StandardThreadFactoryBuilder.newThreadFactory(\"duplicateCommandsThread\")` here. I'm marking it as a question because I don't see how it could be missing from this PR but not showing up as a diff here. A refactor with master sh
❗️ Update the javadoc for this method to reflect the new parameter.
✏️  Could do this with a single expression:\```\return executionRequest.getInputData()\    .filter(Literal.class::isInstance)\    .map(Literal.class::cast)\    .collect(toMap(Literal::getId Literal::getValue));\```
This doesn't forward the `this` but it's probably irrelevant ????‍♀️ 
That's actually one reason I like this new solution better but `dist` was definitely built. I'm not sure it just didn't seem to work. ????‍♂️ 
❓ Do we want to incur the overhead of the extra set creation instead of just iterating/adding to the `foundResults` set?\Not sure if its worth it but could be since this could be used very heavily
❓ Rational?\Many queries might just be 20 items. or 250.  2048 default set size seems a little extreme since it will be very difficult to gauge how much it will actually need
Yep ???? It really bothered me how the line ends were *almost* aligned but not quite. Idk it was a bit of an experiment. If you think it looks ugly I can still revert it ????‍♂️
⚠️ What about birthdays without year? See `X-APPLE-OMIT-YEAR`. This could cause problems and should be tested/handled properly.
⭕️ collectLibraryToSourceSetMapping
I can also see that bit of code being a function or put into the upstream role which accepts `plugin-name` but that's for a refactor / ☔️  day
LGTM ✨ \\Asking questions for the sake of it what do you think about changing it to the following? Makes it a little more predicable. Only `DISABLE_TUNNEL=true` will _truly_ disable it.\\```\if (... && process.env.DISABLE_TUNNEL !== true)\```
Whoops! ????‍♂️ 
❓ Should this show `preview` mode for the PRs? On the incremental we still don't want to push the results to the sonarqube server that should only be done on the respective branches (master 2.12.x etc)
❓ same question on preview mode as DDF version of this file
????‍♂️ Everything worked okay for me so far. Idk if I even need those in the `packages/react-reconciler` area. There’s also a `rollup` warning right now for this package and apparently I broke bundling `ReactDOM`.
❓ Since we have to assume that results will always be returned in the same order for paging to work properly I was thinking that we might be able to only keep the ID of the _last_ metacard returned and drop everything that comes prior and including that 
❓ Why are you using the property accessors here?
❓ Have we done anything to check if this impacts backwards compatibility with old workspaces?
❤️  the formatting.. so much easier to scan
⚠️  This line won't compile because _extensions may not contain stored properties_.

Nice catch ✅ 
✏️  You don't need the empty line between these sentences (but they should still be on different lines). The empty line causes them to render on separate lines in the docs which is confusing because the sentences are directly related.
❗️  Same comment as above. This section comes right after the \"Exporting/Importing Configuration Settings\" section and they both lay out the exact same steps. One of the import sections should be removed.
❓ Other question I have is should we even be going into detail about the interfaces that we're explicitly asking them to not implement? Seems like any integrator who's implementing a migratable will never go here to see the methods on the Migration API c
❗️ This comment applies to the many lines below that go into the methods of each interface. In the actual docs (I'm looking at the HTML version) the bullet point lists of methods are not rendering correctly. Only the last method in the list is showing.
❗️  This whole section is the same as the export steps in the \"Exporting/Importing Configuration Settings\" section. That section gets placed right before this one so it's very repetitive. One of them should be removed.

Nah I also prefer `int`s here. It makes it a tiny bit messier when dealing with the transition between AWS and Layer0 (`int(aws.Int64Value(service.DesiredCount))` etc.) but I prefer Layer0 entities to be using `int`s instead of `int64`s.\\✅

Why we use defferent \"c\"? I see:\-  Copyright (c) \-  Copyright (C) \-  Copyright (©)

I based the \"released\" value on the publish date of 6to5 on npm. Happy to change it though. ????‍♂️ 
❓ Shouldn't we use a temporary directory here instead the user's home directory (`@TemporaryFolder` junit Rule)? That will ensure that nothing gets left behind after the tests are run.
❓ The content store's directory is located under `${ddf.home}/data/content/store`. Should we use the same directory? That way we wouldn't have to change the `default.policy` file.

❓ Should these be separate test cases where we expect an exception to come out as opposed to having to catch them with a try/catch?
❓ If you are putting them package private for testing only then you shouldn't need to suppress warnings just keep the @VisibleForTesting annotation. Would protected be better if that is the case.

❌ Missing class documentation. I'd like all our classes to have some explanation what they are there for internal or not. This makes it much easier for others to make changes later.
⭕️ What is this change about?
⭕️ You mean \"over all exclusions\"?
❌ I had to look three times at this class to make sure this was safe - a `null` `List` is always weird. Why not have a single private constructor with two arguments and two public factory methods?
⭕️  Why did we bump this again if 4.4 isn't out yet?
⭕️ `Application` is a pretty confusing name to me. While technically correct I first think of an \"app\" or of a government form before thinking of \"something that is going to be applied\". Is there some better term we could use here?
⭕️ Is this run in a thread-safe context? If so we should probably document this at the class javadoc level.
⭕️ If it is not included elsewhere.
⭕️ What's the reasoning behind this change?
⭕️ Why is this no longer a Set? 
⭕️ It seems like replacing the `Map` with a more explicit class like `PendingOptionalModules` with methods like `isPending(id)` and `getPendingDependencies(id)` and `addDependency(id dependency)` would make this code clearer.
❌ This probably needs try-finally
⭕️ Also a duplicate I think
⭕️ Seems like this could be inlined into `moduleWithVersion(ModuleIdentifier mi String version)` to avoid the awkward name.
⭕️ Unnecessary now?
⭕️ Why don't we add some generic logic which iterates over all libraries defined above and manages them instead of adding these rules one-by-one by hand?
⭕️ This seems like a duplicate
⭕️ I'd call this `failed(Throwable)`
⭕️ Maybe \"DependencySubstitutionResult\"?

❗️  PATH.toFile()
❓  If you haven't run assertions against the captured values do you really need this? 
❓  How about a try-with-resources block? 
❗️  Cannot rely on the contract provided by `toString()`. We should use `TEMP_TIMESTAMP_FILE_PATH.toFile()` instead. 
❓  Is this a transitive dependency for camel stuff? I'm not sure how it's related since it deals with JDBC. 
❓  If you used a temporary folder in the unit test couldn't you make these private? 
❗️  TEMP_FILE_PATH.toFile()
❗️  Here as well: `new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(TEMP_TIMESTAMP_FILE_PATH.toFile()));`
❓  We're performing validation an extra level down the call stack and then cascading the return. Could we move this check as a first step to `scheduleDeletion()` perhaps? 
❓  How about we use a try-with-resources block for all this? It'll make it very concise: \```\try (ObjectInputStream stream = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(...)))\{ \   return (Instant) objectInputStream.readObject();\} catch (...) {\   
❓  Is this needed? I think the calling conditions (in the `else` block) guarantee this file does exist. 
❗️  Should probably use the `FileInputStream(File)` version of the ctor. There are no contractual obligations on `toString()` such that this is guaranteed to succeed in the future. Do this instead:\```\new FileInputStream(TEMP_TIMESTAMP_FILE_PATH.toFile

❓ Why is this needed? We already have the following block which is intended to catch exactly this case. For example no special casing is needed for `IFormattable f = $\"\";`.\\https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/4b1c677e0161df22f12073a1493747532152b115
❗️ This analyzer isn't the place to do this. The new C# 7.2 features do not affect the use of `var` from the perspective of this analyzer.
❗️ For the `ImplicitTypeEverywhere()` options this should report a diagnostic. `Span<T>` is not a special case the same way string interpolation with `IFormattable` is not a special case.
It was my attempt at making sense of component organization and what should be responsible for what. Clearly it's all still hard to follow ????‍♀️ 
❓ Is there any advantage to using a `version` directive here? Will the release branch be updated with patch releases etc?
❓ I guess this is because we've switched to `glog` in navigator.
❓ So how do we decide whether to use the `internalversion` or the `versioned` APIs? I guess I can see why the API server its self should use the internal versions but why shouldn't the controller also use the internal APIs?
❓ So we no longer have to compile these binaries? Where do they get compiled now?

❓ Should we still keep the original assertion? If not we should rename the test method.\❓ Can we be more specific in the new assertion i.e. make sure the extracted text contains \"something\" instead of just using `notNullValue()`?

Fixed ❤️ 
❓  should this comment clarify why we always add extracted attributes in case those conditions ever change?
✅ Fair enough. Using the default Elasticsearch cluster name tends to create problems with other Elasticsearch clusters in the same network possibly unknown to the users installing Graylog.
❗️ See my note about changing this to an instance field by changing the manner in which you construct this.
❓ Why this replace instead of just writing your format string with `+` instead of spaces?
❗️ Once `deletionScheduled` has been converted to an instance field and this is a singleton managed by blueprint this method will no longer need to be synchronized. Which is good as `deleteFiles` would also have needed to be synchronized to protect.
✏️ Don't love that this is static. Might be better to make it an instance field and then expose a package-private getter for it so that the value can be accessed in `InsecureDefaultsCollector`.
❗️ Instead of doing this and instead of maintaining `UserPropertiesDeletionScheduler.deletionScheduled` as a static field make this an injected constructor param created as a bean in the blueprint.

✏️ Alternatively could check if `instanceof AutoCloseable`. On the off chance Karaf were to introduce a closeable persistence manager of its own in the future.
✏️ With an update to the `ConfigurationPersistencePlugin` interface such that it throws `UncheckedIOException` instead of the checked version these methods could then be updated to simply call `forEach` on a returned stream from an updated `asPlugins` me
✏️ My preference is to return and operate on interfaces and abstract classes wherever possible rather than concrete classes. It makes little difference here but is a generally good habit to have.
✏️ Could return a `Stream<ConfigurationPersistencePlugin>` instead to minimize object creation.
✏️ Probably best to reference this block of code you've copied from the specific release version tag or commit hash; otherwise it's likely to shift about and not correlate correctly.
✏️ Probably worth adding a comment to the effect that this file is not currently being used but is here for future deployments in which the OSGi security manager has been turned on.
This looks great!  I think we might be able to do some conditional rendering React magic here if you feel inspired by this: https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html ✨ 
❗️ If there is no compelling reason not to do so we should definitely be logging through the `SecurityLogger` which will protect against log forgery/injection and other potential issues.
✏️ An alternate (but ultimately not much better) streaming implementation:\```java\    ObjectClassDefinition objectClassDefinition = ddfConfigAdmin.getObjectClassDefinition(pid);\    if (objectClassDefinition == null) {\      return;\    }\    \   
✏️ This doesn't feel like an `IOException` and that's the only documented exception. Would definitely be clear enough to add this rt exception to the documentation of the interface.
✏️ These are excellent uses of inline comments to explicate workflow. However you might consider extracting each block into its own private method. Then this method would be setup; check conditions and comment; call methods for each case.\\It's a matte

Oh and here one-sided space ❌ 
☝️ Please make sure to either always return a boolean or undefined. 
☝️ You're mutating the error object which might result in unwanted behavior. Please use either `Object.assign` or the property spread operator to circumvent unwanted side-effects. 
☝️ Please adjust the transformation to either use `forEach` or even better to _properly_ use `map`. You're mutating `errorSchemaCopy` instead of mapping the values – I assume you did so to remove unwanted errors. You can either `filter` the list of errors
☝️  The provided name should already be formatted – formatting the name here could lead to unwanted behavior.  
☝️ Based on the usage I assume that this const should actually be a boolean. Please use the `some` operator or adjust your `reduce` to return a boolean.

❓ Ok to keep a reference to the `props` passed in or do we need to make a copy?
❓ Looks like this is only used to compare the `Dictionary` with another one. Could we get rid of this getter and have the compare logic inside this class instead? If we need the getter do we need to worry about changes made on the returned `Dictionary`?

❓ I was going to ask if this is the correct branch in your forked repo but it looks like you've applied the changes there too: https://github.com/munnerz/code-generator/tree/release-1.8
❓ Are we still using the `third_party` sub-directory
❓ This should be Copyright Kubernetes I guess. 
❓ So this is where we get better type checking. Great.
❓ Could you use type `FilterFunc` for the return signature? Is `FilterFunc` public? If not should it be?
❌ These shouldn't be part of the public API they are only for the scan plugin.
❌ Missing class documentation.
❌ This is not a task so it seems this is the wrong category.
❌ This doesn't really make sense to me - Starting and finishing a build operation for each piece of output a test creates. That would clutter the trace output pretty quickly. Wouldn't it be better to aggregate the output in the test finished event?
❌ This would make `TestDescriptor` part of the protocol between the build tool and the scan plugin. I think this is contrary to the \"just what we need\" approach we used in other places.
The more I think about it the more it probably just makes sense to have some sane limit if 5 is what we have 5 it is. ????‍♂️

@gucalder we are going to be creating our own mechanism for custom obsolete messages and attributes soon similar to what you are doing here so we recommend just making this simple for the time being since it will change in the near future ☺️

❓ Do we care if the inverse case is true where inputDesc's keySet has a key that inputs doesn't?
❗️ Same comment about callers retaining mutability.

❓ Return a defensive copy instead?
❓ Why both the void setters and the fluent setters? Are bean semantics needed by anything?
✏️ Might be worthwhile to extract an abstract base class for this and other classes that have the common DataDescription interface.
❓ Will these formatter hints still work with the Google formatter?
❓ Commenting here but it applies in other places as well. Should defensive copies be made of collections when passing them into these classes or is mutability from the callers not a concern?
✏️ This would be a bit simpler using Guava:\```java\SetView<String> missingProcessIds = Sets.difference(processIds foundProcessIds);\```
❓ Should we be worried about the size of these streams? They're getting converted to Strings and staying around for at least a little more time; is the risk of them overloading the system's memory something we should try to mitigate?
❓ Do we care that the job ids are exposed as query params? Is it a vulnerability for someone to get that id and use it for another query?
❗️ This does not do what is desired. The input collections can still be modified by the callers.
❓ Would it be better/safer to return an `Optional<ProcessMonitor>` so null checks can be avoided?
✏️ Should be coming from ddf reactor pom.

❌ What do we need this for?
❌ Why are we using the requested version here?
❌ I don't think we need this heavy nesting. We just need a key object containing project configuration module. This can be `Comparable` so it orders in the desired way.
❌ Resolution can be lenient in which case the build will not fail. It seems that our lock writing logic currently depends on the build result in order to determine whether to lock or not. I think in addition we also need to check whether a resolution res

❗️ This list is added to on line 292 but not accessed returned or used in any other way.
✏️ By overloading this method you should be able to get two benefits: reduce the cognitive complexity of each method and make the input/output of each clearer. Take a look at this gist for an example: https://gist.github.com/coyotesqrl/3ff1f1c069faa6ef7c
✏️ I have a strong dislike for streaming code with multiline lambdas embedded in them; I find they reduce readability. Suggest extracting this lambda to a private method so the structure of the stream is better highlighted.

✏️ This particular change seems a little silly to me. I don't know how I feel about breaking out an exception message to insert a const in the middle of it.
Ah so right! I think it was somehow only working with 3 children ????‍♀️ . Updated!
I prefer to make spaces explicit rather than part of string because it's easy for someone to think a space at the start of a string is a typo and remove it. Personal preference not blocking. ????‍♂️ 
❓ This one is *not* intuitive to me. The caller has the ability to specify a cancellation token yet we're hiding that cancellation from the resulting task. Is there any other way to implement this check at a higher level?
❓ Should we log a `warn` instead of `info`? This may be something the admin can fix and is fairly important.\✏️  Nit: Since this is really logging a message and not printing to the console should we name it `logInfoMessage()` or `logWarnMessage()` inste
❓ Isn't there anything we could verify to prove that we got here and things worked as expected like we used to do?
❓ If we move `commandString()` outside the `try` we should consider moving this conditional outside as well and return right away. That would reduce the indentation depth and possibly the cyclomatic complexity of the method.
❓ Shouldn't we have either `required` or `default` for this?
❓ Shouldn't this be `required` with no `default` value instead?
✏️  Indentation seems off here.
❓ Should we move this line before the `try` block and use the `commandString` in the `catch (RuntimeException)` log messages? That would help admins know which command failed to run.
❓  I think it's faster to use a `Set<String>` instead for the `ILLEGAL_CHARACTERS` collection and parallel streaming the config entry value itself leveraging the `contains` method of `Set` for more power as opposed to the `contains` method of `String`. 
❗️ You've created an argument captor but you're not using it to validate the captured value. Instead replace the call to `capture()` with a predefined predicate to put a bounds on expected arguments for example:\```\verify(testConfig times(1)).update(
❓  Could we make this a `Set<String>` for faster lookups? Preferably a `HashSet`. 
Ah sorry this is a FastBoot test of course ????‍♂️ Yes I do thing we should change those tests to set the header directly instead of relying on `write` but that's something for another PR.
❌ Missing test case: Resolving one configuration does not influence the result of resolving another configuration. Or in other words: Make sure that metadata rules don't accidentally modify the immutable metadata in the cache.\\I'd test this by resolvin
❌ Needs to be linked to guarantee order of rules.
❌ This logic seems to belong into the `DependencyMetadataRules` class instead of having the algorithm copied in several places.
⭕️ I think this belongs into the `withVariant` method. There's no point in creating an object if we already know it can't be used.
❌ I think this should be on the package level.
⭕️ I'm not sure I like the javadoc here since it focusses on implementation details. I'd probably be a bit more abstract and just say \\- the name of the module you want\- the group of the module you want. A group allows having modules of the same nam
⭕️ I don't think such implementation details belong here. If this class had a proper method to transform a set of dependencies (instead of several getters that expose internal details) then you can just look for callers of that method to know where it is
⭕️ This is confusing to me (including the comment further down). Matching happens on variants not on dependencies.
❌ A factory seems like the wrong abstraction here. The word \"Factory\" implies I get something new on each call.
⭕️ I don't think this test will tell us anything important. All the code that could affect the behavior here has been deleted.
⭕️ We don't really need a test for this since this now effectively duplicates our cross-version tests for artifact resolution reuse.
⭕️ This essentially duplicates tests for normal repository caching. All the code that could have lead to different behavior here has been deleted.
⭕️ This was a test for the portal resolver which no longer exists. We should either rename it or consolidate it with other tests for maven/ivy plugin repos. 
⭕️ The tests in this class now duplicate tests for maven/ivy repos I think. All the code that could have lead to different behavior here has been deleted.

❓ Wrong copyright header. Should be (c) Kuberneties authors I'd have thought.
Sure - I think that isn't too much responsibility at for the Controller to handle. ✅

❓ It looks like the only thing that matters is the existence of `restart.jvm` not its content. To avoid confusion shouldn't we just create the file like we do on L24 instead of putting the `RESTART` word in the file here?
❓ Should we use the `/f` option like we do on Linux? How about `/q`?

`'\\n'` and `\"\\n\"` are the same thing in JavaScript so instead of disabling the ESLint rule on this line we could use `'\\n'` and ESLint would be happy ☺️

The directive I described earlier wouldn't be useful here since enter key and click events do different things.  Oh well.  ????‍♀️ 
❓ Should we use `${ddf-catalog}` instead of just `catalog`?
❓ The email will not always be the attribute required to share a workspace. It is configurable via the Admin UI in `Search UI` -> `Configurations` -> `Workspace Security`. Should we note that somewhere here in the Share a Workspace section?

How did we arrive on this magic appIdKey ❓ 
✏️ It's belt & suspenders as we _know_ what the checked exception is; however you should affirm that it is `instanceof` prior to your cast. In the else block (where you'll never actually end up) you can throw a `new IOException(e.getCause())`
✏️ Same comment about checking the class.
➕ the idea. I don't think we super future-proof things all the time. This is partially why we are such a high output team ???? . It makes sense to call it analytics we could build it up as we add or remove vendors.\\In regards of the passing of the `req

Ok - I think I was only thinking of a single link being deleted but in the case of multiple links being deleted this should be a continue. Moved out of helper and updated to continue ✅ 
❓ How often is this exception happening?
✏️  These should be separate tests.
❗️ I don't think we can simply remove the `null` check. If `exchangeFile` is `null` we will blow up here: https://github.com/codice/ddf/pull/2604/files#diff-7cfc82542fb64f645c17b3051bd71df3R171. Any reason we need to keep going if `exchangeFile` is `null
❓ Any specific reason we've added this conditional? This feels a little overkill since the method will only be called on failure and ingest error will most likely always be enabled.
*I* ❤️ *the performance of* `get` *and* `apply` *on* `ListMap`!  Also it provides a way to index on key-value pairs and maintain iteration order based on insertion order.  It also allows us to read the features as a map in the JSON.  For instance:\\```
The only place using null was the test so I just changed it to undefined ????‍♂️ 
⭕️ I'd add a section title \"IDE integration\" and shorten the first sentence. I.e. \"Please be aware that...\" is redundant since we want users to be aware of everything in this document.
❌ All 5xx are critical. We should use something like 401 as an example of \"uncritical\".
❌ Why introduce a new type? We already have one for http errors and we can add something like `isSeverError`

What exception should I raise? (Python ignorant here ☝️ ).
Oh sorry I guess I failed my rebase ????‍♂️ 
```diff\- def initialize(schema executor_class: executor_class)\+ def initialize(schema executor_class:) \```\✅
Yep technically this won't cause an issue I just think it's more tidy to keep 1 data file per table.\✨ \\Then it's also easier to find in the source.
I've already fixed this on `master` please rebase ⚡️  
❓ Should we make the review rule a little bit more formal between partial and full review and approval process? I'm not sure people would know just by reading this and communicating when to switch to full approval might be difficult.\\A few suggestions
❓  These numbers are awfully close which almost makes me worried about slight environmental differences. 
`__block` is unnecessary here.\\I don't like using `kp` for a name here but I don't have any other great ideas for how to otherwise distinguish this from `keyPaths` ????‍♂️
Seeing as the data is static here this is probably better served as a decorator...\\````javascript\@track({ action: \"Click\" label: \"Play video\" })\playVideo() {\  ...\}\````\\that's what makes it \"declarative\" as the lib authors say ????‍♂️ 
✏️ I would just ask that you include a link back to this line in the Jira ticket so it doesn't get lost.

@mountaindogmama this is correct ☝️ 
✨ white space ✨ ???????? 
Hmm we should be sticking to the WDS grid as much as possible. This is getting into some strange territory ????‍♀️ 
I tried to only turn sudo on for the roles that needed it but they all needed it for at least one step ????‍♂️ 
❌ We should flip this around: The message is always the same. We should only write it once and list all repos we tried.
⭕️ I'd probably put this on `ArtifactRepositoryInternal` as we have no use case for users calling this at the moment.
⭕️  We shouldn't speak of the \"plugin class\" because that would be the `JavaPlugin`. We should instead call it the \"convention class\" e.g. `JavaPluginConvention`.
Well maybe we should separate `Block` and `Slog` but currently `Slog` is part of `Block` so I don't see a reason why this module isn't called `Pos.Binary.Block.Slog` ????‍♂️ 
❌ This is a breaking change. Flat dir repos don't need a version. I.e. you can just have `guava.jar`.
❗️ :arrow_right: Let's remove everything related to fixes for the first pass.
❓ Is this comment correct?
❗️ ➡️ Let's remove them.
➡️ Let's file/examine this as a follow-up issue after we can get our hands on the first build and play with it some.
❗️ ➡️ The IOperation feature flag no longer exists in the master branch so the code to add it here can be removed.

✏️  \"our own config installer replacement (i.e. config udpater) now\"
❗️ We need to process each config objects we find in cfg admin as if it was an update so we can update etc right away. This will account for a race condition where either changes to config objects occurred before your bundle got initialized or again if fi
❗️ Versions should be pushed to the ddf pom
❗️ The above jsr305 dependency should be scoped as \"provided\" and we should not be embedded it here. This pulls in the findbugs library at runtime which contains CVE issues. We only use it for annotations so it is perfectly ok not to provide that library

✏️ This feels strange to me. I'm not sure why you wouldn't just push the calls for `getBundle().getBundleContext()` down to `getQueryFilterTransformerServices` and change that method to return a `Stream`.
❓ I wouldn't have thought that the Navigator controller should ever need to delete or update elasticsearchclusters. Maybe instead:\ * elasticsearchclusters: get list watch\ * elasticsearchclusters/status: update\ * pilots: get listwatch create up
❓ Should we check for same owner here too?
❓ Maybe document what each of these phases means. Something like: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-phase
❓ Seems like the signature should remain `sync(key string)` and perform this check in the caller....and just blow up since this should always be `string` as far as I can see.\\Thats how Kubernetes Deployment controller deals with it: https://github.com
❓ Does a pilot controller need permission to do anything other than update `pilot/status`?
❓ So this is the case where kubelet has sent sigterm to the pilot but we need to continue running while we evict shards from this database node etc and update the Pilot status.\Perhaps expand a little on the comment above.
Could you please change the single quotes to double quotes here? Thanks homie ❤️ 
✏️  same comment as above
✏️  just add a quick comment that the cache will be updated by writeIfNecessary() if necessary ???? 
❗️ Missing audit about failing to delete.
❓ Does that mean that this would now bubble out all the way to the code that initiated an update with a felix filename that has an extension we do not support?\❗️ I am concerned about that.\✏️  We definitely a log for this ... warning?
❗️ As per a previous comment we shouldn't blindly cast even if we know by design these are the only exceptions that are thrown. That side can evolve differently and we would then have a problem here.
✏️  Instead of \"Felix filename\" can we just reference the actual property name that was changed? (i.e. FELIX_FILENAME) 
❓ Are those traces turned on by default? If so then this trace would be noisy.
✏️  \"Removed a deleted config file\" instead of \"Removing ...\".
❓ Why don't we go directly to osgi 's config admin for this?
❗️ As per a previous comment we shouldn't blindly cast even if we know by design these are the only exceptions that are thrown. That side can evolve differently and we would then have a problem here.
✏️  Let's be consistent and make sure all your audits use either the absolute path or a relative one.
❗️ Same comment as above
❓ Can this return null?
❓ can `getTokenHolder` or `getSecurityToken` return null? If so this could throw a NPE
❗️ One problem here is that your audit for failure below doesn't catch the IOException that could occur on close from the try-with-resource.
✏️  \"Updated config file\" instead of \"Updating ...\"
This was just hanging around ????‍♂️ 
Sorry my refactors getting merged probably caused all of your conflicts ☹️ 
❓ Wouldn't it have been easier to keep the lock inside the DelegatingPersistenceManager and acquire the readlock in its delete() and store() method only? That would have concentrated everything in one single place.
❓ How about deletion? Shoudn't we also lock the read lock?
✏️  Why not use a standard ReadWriteLock? The advantage of that one is that you could give to your class either the write or the read lock based on your design as opposed to have them get the right one. It clarifies the code since they receive a Lock with
❓ Does this still catch cases like this?\\```csharp\  public static void Method<T>()\  { \    T t;\    void Local<T>()\    {\      { // <-- note this set of added braces\        Out(out t);\        Console.WriteLine(t);\      }\    }\    Loca
I gotcha thanks. ✅ 
Maybe add `# A list of appeals that had other appeals merged into them`(< right❓ )
Cool. ✅ 
❓ Should we bold **abbreviated review process** (or have a header) to make that part easier to find when that review process is in effect?
❓ How about `ABBREVIATED REVIEW PROCESS` to be consistent with the text in the notes below?\❓ Do we need to mention the branch names?
❗️  Doing this would make us vulnerable to deadlock. It's unlikely but it **could** happen as follows:\1. Some configuration gets submitted for persistence which will be referred to as the **config thread**. \2. The **config thread** acquires a _write
Thanks for the suggestion! I've added this in \4ebb65d\\> I'm currently looking into ways of keeping dojo and the JS API out of the global namespace completely without having to sacrifice any functionality\\???? ☝️ that would be amazing and solve most
in fact every job using the `kubernetes_verify` is a pile of dirty hacks owned by sig-testing ????‍♂️ 
????‍♂️  Of course. That should be fixed now.
Shouldn't it be ✅ for API300?
❕ Now that this throws instead of returning null it should be named `Create` instead.
It might be easier if you returned a `List<File>` here. You can easily convert any array into a List by using `Arrays.asList`.\\I tend to try to avoid using arrays directory but that is just me ????‍♂️ 
Should we ✂️ this second \"of\"? -> representing internal engine metrics
⭕️ Wouldn't it be better to assert that the trees are the same instead of checking in a point in time? That would make it easier to upgrade this test in the future.
❌ This is in master now so this test needs an update
⭕️ It's just a coincidence that we implement them the same way. I wouldn't tell users about that it would be confusing for Maven users I think.
✏️  This message gets displayed to the admin who made the mistake. It should be more specific about what about the configuration was invalid. In other words maybe \"Invalid UI Configuration: The color and background properties must only contain a color nam
I ❤️  how readable this is.

oops - i commented on @nehayward review about the same thing yesterday and then ended up doing the same thing myself. will fix ✅ 
❓ Any reason this check is not at the start of this method?
✏️ This might look a lot cleaner if the concern of parsing the users.attributes file was broken out into a separate class.
Adding a simple test case for when there aren't any tags. ✅ 
Is this `.bind(this)` necessary?  Wouldn't `this` in `_retryNow` (next method below ⬇️) be the same `this` already?
seriously... what's with the formatting issue ????‍♂️ 
You can use a return-type as this is PHP 7.1 ❤️ ????
The code block for the tools also seems a little off because the rest is just a normal list and would make sense to make \this into a normal list.\Somehow removing one space here fixes it. Not sure why this is even an issue ????‍♂️ 
you might skip length checking by providing such expectations:\should(nextState.cards.pic).be.deepEqual( [{ rank: '10' suit: '♦' }] );\should(nextState.cards.adam).be.deepEqual( [{ rank: '10' suit: '♥' }] );
as above why not just:\should(nextState.cards.pic).be.deepEqual( [\   createCard('10♥')\   createCard('10♥')\   createCard('J♦')\] );\\Worth checking that stock is empty as well
I love the way you comment. It looks sweet ❤️

@JorgeBucaran but then HOAs would still have to check if the original `view` returns a `function` correct?\\I'm going to actually go back to a direct call until someone complains about their special snowflake `view` ❄️

❌ No longer necessary should now be using a callable provider.
????‍♂️ Sorry! Will update the PR. Do you care about having it rebased into a single commit?
Okay I made that change but I don't really like the boxes being checked by default. I don't know why but for some reason I prefer booleans that default to false ????‍♂️  
????‍♂️  Wow. Yep!
⚠️ Also no rule check should only be performed for `constraint` and not `override` because just the `name` attribute is useful in case of overrides. Not the same case with constraints.

????‍♂️ oops that's my bad
is `debian:jessie` underneath a few layers ✔︎
❓ Do we need to worry about trying to set multiple values in a single-valued attribute?
❗️ Our convention is to mark parameters and return values that can be `null` with `@Nullable` instead of using `@NotNull`.
❗️ We should make the `cachedMetacardAttributeNameToSystemHighValuesMap` map `volatile` since it could be re-assigned in the `update` method while we're calling `entrySet()` on it. We should also consider adding an inline comment where the map is declared
❗️ It kind of bugs me that we are reading the `users.attributes` file in this plugin. It tightly couples it with the file format and its location which means that as soon as that file moves or changes this plug-in will break. @stustison is there a bett
❓ Should `karafEtcSystemPropertyName` be a constant like the other ones?
❓ Instead of streaming over the list to cast each element could we declare `systemHighAttributeValues` to be of type `List<Serializable>`?
❓ Should we add more suggestions here e.g. make sure the `users.attributes` file exists its content is valid etc.?
✏️  Could we initialize when we declare the field?
✏️  Unless those are part of the class' API it's usually preferable to keep those `private` and have separate definitions in the unit tests. It ensures that someone doesn't change the value by mistake and breaks things without the unit tests failing.
❓ Actually should we check this in the `update` method itself instead and avoid this check here and the exception altogether? Doing this here forces us to read a file and parse JSON even when there are no properties defined which is kind of a waste.\If
❓ Creating our own exception just for internal problems seems a little overkill. Could we use existing exceptions like `IOException` and/or `IllegalStateException` etc. instead?
❓ `${ddf-catalog}` here? Are there rules for when to use or don't use it?

Just put Andy's cell phone in the comment so people know where to call to complain. ☮️ 
⭕️ I think we should accept `ModuleIdentifier` & friends here instead of individual strings. That makes it much more obvious what this method is about.
⭕️ You might want to cache this fact.
The records manager will not have access to a private Dossiers of an other user. This tests is obsolete ...  ✂️ 
Let's switch the \"I'm\" for a \"We're\" here so it's phrased more like the team taking action and less a robot taking action ????‍♂️ ???? 
✅ Changed
✏️  We might want a debug or trace statement specifying what the solr directory ended up being set to. 
✏️  For both of these do we want to get the `toAbsolutePath` (or the canonical path if it was a `File` object)
✏️  Not necessary to change but we could eventually remove these comments to enforce the styling since our current formatter probably wont make it look atrocious anymore. 
✏️  This could probably be `isNotBlank` eventually.\\Or like above we could use `StringUtils.defaultIfBlank`
I am such a professional ⭐️ 
✏️  Since value will always be `true` here any reason to not just put `true` instead of `value`?
❗️ You can continue catching Throwable here since VirtualMachineErrors was handled just before.\❓ Why are we changing it to Exception? If so then we no longer need the catch(VirtualMachineError)
❗️ There is a change in behavior here. Before it would continue looping to all other plugins where as now it stops at the first failure. Was that what we wanted?
❓ same comment as above
❗️ This line should be removed as it is designed to check the interrupted flag which you know would always return true since you got an interrupted exception.
❓ ❗️  Is it ok to close the index here and yet return it out of this method?
❗️ The exception here is never traced
❓ Was the changed to use the regular toString() intentional? I suspect this was done because a Response object did not have a proper toString(). 
❗️  There was a reason why the original code was doing + instead of using {}. That is because it was using the other form of the method which allows an exception to be passed as a parameter and logged along with its stack trace. This is lost here.
❗️ See my previous comment about resetting the interrupted flag within a loop. It needs to be done outside of the loop.
❗️ Same comment as before with respect to propagating the interrupted exception from within a loop. It needs to be remembered and propagated outside of the loop with a try/finally
I think it's just a bit nicer ergonomically but then again it doesn't compose with other tags very easily so ????‍♂️ 
I think doing that results in a linting ❗️ 
Yeah it’s wired but laravel/framework does the same thing ????‍♂️
✏️ it seems like these properties should be added to system.properties or at least documented somewhere
????‍♂️ I'll add the else block

Yes add section in the this README also since the script is in the same folder.\It will be one place for db things ♻️ 
❗️ It looks like this should be `!failures.isEmpty()` unless I'm missing something.
⭕️ \"10 is the maximum\" doesn't really tell me what this means. Do the numbers have specific meanings or are they arbitrarily assigned?
⭕️ Cast to `Set` to make the `contains()` further down efficient.
Well this way ti'm just checking wether we get the expected error in the fault case. maybe better to check for errorType though ✌️

❌ This is not part of the API and needs no incubating flag/documentation.
❌ Never ignore exceptions. Incap should simply return an empty map if no mapping file was in the working dir. If anything else goes wrong we should issue a full build with a descriptive reason instead of just swallowing the exception. Otherwise we'd just
❌ remove \"for this build\". This is on `CompileOptions` which can be different for every instance.
⭕️ We don't use the term \"intermediates\". You can use \"tmp\" for this.
❌ Not necessary here
❌ This could also use some unit testing just to make sure that each kind of entry is handled correctly.
❌ If there is no working dir then we shouldn't create one here that's just unnecessary IO. We can simply return instead.
❌ Should have fields not a map.
❌ All these messages should be info. Also we don't need a message if everything is okay (i.e. incremental). We only need a message if it isn't.
❌ Should not be a boolean that Gradle parses but come from a method in the incap client library which decides whether it understands that processor. The properties file should probably contain an enum value not a boolean saying something like \"simple\"
⭕️ A better name would probably be \"IncrementalAnnotationProcessingTest\"
❌ Missing unit test coverage now that this class has much more complex logic.
❌ Should only be done if incap is enabled. That prevents processors from writing mapping files when none are needed.
⭕️ `compileOnly` - it's just there for annotations we don't want to leak the processor implementation to our downstream clients. Good citizens among the processor authors separate their annotations and processor into two jars.
⭕️ Why use Strings when we have a rich type for our annotation processor properties?
❌ Should check first whether the processor path is empty. This means there is a missing test (or you didn't run it)
❌ Should return a `List<AnnotationProcessorInfo>` one for each processor in the dir/jar or empty if there are none.
❌ This method shouldn't exist. All of them should be processors otherwise there should be no ProcessorInfo.
Yeah it makes sense! Let me figure out how to phrase it ☺️

✏️ I think if you extracted the constant groups here and in some of the other methods you could clean up a lot of these method calls. It looks like all the other parameters are the same.
✏️ I like to flag the metacard with validation warnings for cases like this so they are easy to find and fix manually if desired.
❓ What happens if this refreshes while transforms are being run? Should it be synchronized with the entry point?
❓ I notice these artifacts are under test resources. Is it worth including these in `<home>/{schema|schematron}` and maybe configuring some validators for them?
❓ Has anyone used the resource and metadata security fields for policy decisions yet or are they still just metadata?

@nicolelehrer We're unwrapping operation results all over the place (☹️) already so I don't want to change this as part of this feature. It's probably better to evaluate and refactor this paradigm as part of a more wholistic look.
✏️  At this point does it not make sense to just have `DelegatingPersistenceManager` implement the `ServiceTrackerCustomizer` interface? I'm saying that because this inner class literally just delegates to a method on the outer class.
Adding a check just to avoid panic. It’ll just drop the message. Receiving a peerScore is the contract of the interface but it is a public interface so we can’t speak for third-parties.\\✔️

❓ Can we use `ddfHomePath.resolve(path)` instead?
❗️ Agreed. We should use specific exceptions not just `Exception`. Comment applies to the following tests as well.
❓ Could we use `parseMap(InputStream Charset)` instead of reading the file into a string?
❗️ Since we're returning a `List` we should validate the order as well.
❗️ `supportedClaimTypes` needs to be `volatile` to make sure it's not being changed while `getSupportedClaimTypes()` is called.
❗️ Since `json` is a member variable being set here and used in two other methods its access needs to be synchronized somehow otherwise we're going to be running into issues if it changes while it's being used.

❓ Why do we need to remove the namespace from `->Client`? This pattern appears at least once more and I'm not familiar with it.
❓ Maybe I'm not noticing something but how exactly does `brickftp/file-download` resolve? Likely because it is extending a protocol which places any extensions in that namespace I guess?

⭕️ I don't think there's a difference between none and malformed as far as the client is concerned. Both cases mean we can't trust it. I'd probably call this \"unspecified\".
❌ Should take a File (jar or classes dir) and look for the meta-inf entry so that Gradle doesn't have to duplicate knowledge about where incap expects that entry.

❓ if a user defines `dae_file` together with some storage in yml this function will `w` truncate file and overwrite everything. Is it a feature by design and the rationale? 
Key point ⭐️ 1: get options of storage controllers and drives from yml definition and inject to the DAE model. Then `dae_helper.create_dae_node` will dump this information to a file defined by `dae_file` in yml. As a result qemu options take this dae fi

✏️ This might read more cleanly with a format string.\```java\throw new IllegalStateException(String.format(\"Could not load xsl file (%s) from system: %s\" xslFile e.getMessage()) e.getCause());\```
❓ Is that class going to be guaranteed to be exported by some bundle by the time this comes up? Or (haven't looked ahead yet) have we ensured that it is a dependency for starting the feature in which this bundle is exposed?

❓ Does this suppression still apply? If not it should be removed so it doesn't inadvertently mask a real problem down the road.
Good catch. I had coded (and tested) the default before I added the `name` field to the registration form - so I had tested it only against `nil` values ????‍♂️

➡️ Discussions are already in progress to reduce the number of times this is shown.
❓ Why is this setter an instance one if the attribute being changed is static?
✏️  If branding can be `null` then the parameter should be annotated with `@Nullable`. Otherwise you should be safe to use `Optional.of()`
❗️  We should define versions in the parent pom and reference them via variables here.

✏️ I think you might be able to get around using an argument capture and that for loop with something like:\```java\verify(mockMetacard)\        .setAttribute(argThat(hasProperty(\"values\" containsInAnyOrder(\"USA\" \"FRA\" \"CHN\"))));\```
Hey mate I'm actually taking the entire package object and passing it across so you could effectively get more than the version: \```\\"aws/aws-sdk-php\" => {#716 ▼\    +\"name\": \"aws/aws-sdk-php\"\    +\"version\": \"3.40.0\"\    +\"source\": {#721 ▶}\

✏️  Should add a test for invalid country code as well.
❓ Is `Nullable<int?>` a situation we need to worry about? It's not semantically correct but it is expressible in source code.
❓ Did you mean to have `using System.Threading.Tasks;`? Same applies to the other tests that reference `Task<T>`.
oh gdi I thought I did that ????‍♀️ 
????‍♂️ Yes completely right sorry.\\Actually just out of curiosity as they are booleans we probably can just use `kwargs['verify_certs'] = not kwargs['ssl_no_validate']`
Ooh yeah I believe this was an artifact of when this test was in typescript. We can definitely just use `document.fullscreenElement = true` now! Good catch ⚾️ 
Turns out `onMarkerSelect` is not used at all ????‍♂️
❓ Should we account for the possibility of multiple spaces i.e. `.split(\" *\")` or skip empty `countryCode` strings?
❓ Instead of repeating L128-134 and L138-144 could we create a private method like `private List<Serializable> processAttributeValue(String attributeName Serializable value)` that creates the attribute value(s) and have a single if/else block afterward
❓ Do we need to worry about string trimming for these after splitting

❓ Not sure quite how these fields will be used (updated/read) but any need (thread interactions/wait loops/etc) for these to be volatile?
❓ Any need to consider any synchronization for this reference class?

✏️ This isn't *literally* correct when expansion and match-one/match-all come into play. It's more the other way around. The metacard must be marked in such a way that the guest user's claims permit guest access.

❗️ This suppression is no longer needed/correct.
❗️ This suppression is no longer needed/valid.
❗️ These exceptions not thrown.
✏️ It's not of great import one way or the other but it's a bit of overkill to decorate the stream with a `BufferedInputStream` for a file that's never going to be big.
❗️ Stream needs to be closed.
✏️ If we're going to javadoc this method and its possible exceptional paths we should include an `@throws` declaration for `NoSuchAlgorithmException`.
✏️ Nit: public methods all to the top then protected/package-private and then finally private. You've got this here some public methods below it then a bunch of private methods then finally more public.
❗️ 1. Really dislike the abuse of the bitwise operator here. It _works_ but at the cost of using a construct that's fallen far out of favor.\2. And...as you're never using the value returned from this method there's little value in calculating it.
✏️ This one on the other hand is going to be pretty big and buffering it might be of value.
❗️ Remove `MigrationException` from the throws clause as it is a `RuntimeException`. It can stay in the javadoc.
✏️ I don't love this but as the secret key is written to disk and it would take a malicious developer with access to the system to access this method it's probably okay.
I think it might be right this way - this form is used in several other places. ????‍♂️

❗️  Is there a different name we could use instead of Profile to describe the migration of application feature and bundle state? It could be mixed up with the features we have defined as profiles.
✏️ It would probably be easier to use the `Version` `toString` instead of keeping a list of digits. There is a constructor for `Version` that takes in this string.
✏️ Could specify the generic for this EnumSet
✏️  Typo at \"... we are going to attempt a multiple times\"

❓ Shouldn't `BundleManager.class` be passed  in instead of `ProfileMigratable.class`?
✏️ These test classes would be more readable if the static methods were imported instead.

❓ Instead of using a constructor just to instantiate this class and set the static field I was thinking that we could try to add this method:\```\public static void setCountryCodeConverter(CountryCodeConverter countryCodeConverter) {\    NitfUtilities
❓ Wonder if we shouldn't add a `isExtAttribute(NitfAttribute)` on the `ExtNitfUtility` class instead of having to have this conditional logic here.
❗️ We may want to stick to 4 space indents to keep the file consistent with the other XML files and minimize the differences.
❓ Looks like we dropped the last `FILE_CLASSIFICATON_SECURITY_SYSTEM`. Was that on purpose?
❓ Should we make the name a little bit more specific to prevent this class from becoming a dumping ground for NITF utility methods e.g. `NiftHeaderFieldConverters` or something similar? If we do we could consider removing the `convert` prefix from the 
❗️ We should also add `throws NitfParsingException` to the method signature.
❓ Should we rename to `fipsToStandardCountryCodes()` or something similar?
Mildly irrelevant but I think this was the only place where we import `actionTypes` but don't assign it to an `at` alias. ????‍♀️

❓ `@Nullable` on the return type since we have it on the parameters?
❓ Any reason we didn't make this a non-static class and have blueprint instantiate and inject it where needed? We've done that in the past and had to change the classes down the road because they were impossible to mock and made unit tests more difficult 
✏️  Not a big fan of using the word `Manager` in class names. Could we call it `ApplicationMigrator` or something similar instead?\Same comment for the `FeatureManager` and `BundleManager` classes.
❓ Looks like there's no easy way to pass this down to the `TaskList` constructor instead of making it package-private but having `TaskList` depend on this class seems odd. Should we have two separate constants instead or put the constant in the `TaskList
❓ Instead of having to deal with maps of maps and lists and values could we have created a top-level bean (e.g. `JsonInstallationProfile`) re-used the `JsonApplication` etc. as fields inside it and use those to serialize/deserialize the data? Boon's
✏️  This is one of my pet peeves. Why not call the parameter `type` instead of `clazz`...
❓ Any reason we're not just creating the 3 \"managers\" in the blueprint file and injecting them? That would eliminate the need for two constructors.
❗️ Can we expand `r` and `os` a little? I had to search through the migratable code to figure out what `r` meant.
❓ These methods just return Maps so should we consider changing their names and putting them elsewhere? For instance this one could be named `toMap()` and be in the `ApplicationManager` class? 
❓ Should this method be here? It doesn't look like it has anything to do with JSON and is only used in `ProfileMigratable`.
❓ The name of this class is somewhat misleading since it doesn't deal with JSON but getting typed values from Maps and Lists. Maybe we could call it something like `TypedCollectionAccessor`?

❌ We shouldn't introduce sleeps here. We have `CyclicBarrierHttpServer` for this kind of use case. Please use that instead of the plain `HttpServer`.

⭕️ Shouldn't this only throw `CoreException` to be consistent with other Eclipse APIs?

❓ This test doesn't make sense to me. It's asserting that `getResults().size() == sourceList.size()`. I understand why both equal 3 because of how `getMockSource()` works but it's still conflating several different numbers.
✏️ This is just a list of three references to the same object. If  you really want a list of three mocks you should instantiate three mocks.
✏️ Same as above.
✏️ I'm not a fan of using `sourceList.size()` for the number of hits. I know 0 is 0 either way but it makes the test very confusing to read and could easily lead to errors in the future.
✏️ Source ids are supposed to be unique. CachingFederationStrategy doesn't really care but it's not accurate to how the system is supposed to behave. I'd prefer to mock normal behavior by making these ids unique within the scope of each unit test.

✏️  `private static Map<Object Object> exampleMap = ImmutableMap.of(\"a\" \"A\" \"b\" \"B\" \"c\" \"C\");` instead of lines 50-53
✏️  You can import `static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals` and directly call `assertEquals` in all your tests.
❓ Why did we remove this comment? Are we no longer returning an empty `Properties`?
❓ Why do you have this line?
cleanup commented code ⬆️ 
✏️  You should probably give it a decent looking name like `nonExistentFile.properties`
❓ This is just a question: In the SP's metadata we have an ACS for `PAOS` so would getting the one for `SOAP` return the one for `PAOS` or would it just not return the PAOS one cause it's not part of the supported binding? If it's the latter I suggest add
✏️  I'm in favor of using `assertEquals(\"Returns an empty map\" EMPTY_MAP testMap);` instead of doing `is(equalTo(EMPTY_MAP))`
✏️ This is an accurate statement of what is returned but it doesn't really say anything about what it returned.
✏️ It's a bit of overkill to overuse `@link` tags in javadocs. There can be value in it but it should be used judiciously.
✏️ It would be good to confirm that we can parse a set of multiple sp metadata
❓ what happens if there are multiple \"roads\" nodes within a \"featureMembers\" element?  Does that cause multiple metacards to be created?  Do we have a test case for this?
❗️ Again I don't think we need the marshall implementation 
⭕️ Why not always do a refresh here and leave the workspace operations unchanged? Does the synchronous call not replace the background call?
❓  If the prop file path is absolute shouldn't we be confirming that it is beneath `$ddf.home` before trying to read it?

Yes. We could change that in the future. But the linkResolver does not accept a title ☹️

✏️ I'm on the fence about this so maybe ask around the team to get some opinions: I think this test should probably be encompassed in the first test. I.e. assert on both `EntityInformation` objects in the returned map. It seems odd to parse both metadata
❗️ We should add an assertion that the SOAP url is not there.
✏️ Should we just be getting the correct entity info based on the key of the map instead of iterating through the map? It just seems odd. And then you can verify that the `EntityInformation` retrieved is not null instead of asserting on the ID on line 96.
✏️  You could cache the class loader in memory:\```\private static final ClassLoader CLASS_LOADER = PropertiesLoader.class.getClassLoader();\```
✏️  Can we move this to the `@BeforeClass` so all setup and initialization occurs in the same place? 
❗️ Hardcoding `\"\\n\"` is not cross-platform compatible. Use a format string instead: \```\sb.append(String.format(\"%s=%s%n\" entry.getKey() entry.getValue()));\```\Using `%s` as the placeholder assumes the key and value on `entry` can be safely treate
❗️ Since we're testing each strategy individually this test is pretty worthless / redundant unless we have a deterministic way to verify strategy ordering. Which we should have. \\Another way to put it: This test already tests the functionality tested 
❗️ Instead of mutating state that you've already passed which makes this difficult to follow and verify what is being tested you should have two separate maps. One can be your expected value. One can be the value you pass with the mock. 
❗️ We probably should not have spaces in the keys. They are usually of the form `org.codice.qualifier.qualifier.propertyname` and we should test as such. Also we should test for system property expansions in the keys as well. 
✏️  Use `String.format(...)` instead of concatenation. 
❗️ Note that all `message` parameters to the assertion functions are really just error messages displayed on test failure. Thus I do not think `\"Returns an empty map\"` is descriptive enough to assist with troubleshooting. Perhaps something like: \```\fo
❓ Couldn't find it on [Confluence](https://codice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DDF/pages) but I believe our testing guidelines direct us to use `assertThat` over the vanilla JUnit assertions. @coyotesqrl or @bdeining is this correct? \\Also I want to doubl
✏️  We could be explicit here to make it clearer which are keys and which are values since the `(key value key value ...)` ordering isn't obvious. Maybe: \```\ImmutableMap.of(\"key1\" \"value1\" \"key2\" \"value2\" ...);\```
I thought it might be code style but 2 lines above it adds a space ????‍♂️ \\Actually now I've read that line again I think you can move the variable up a bit and re-use it there too?
`message` from the body. `statusMessage` wouldn't be too bad either ????‍♂️ 
❗️ The following should work and support multiple suggesters in the future.\\```\<requestHandler name=\"/suggest\" class=\"solr.SearchHandler\" startup=\"lazy\">\  <lst name=\"defaults\">\    <str name=\"suggest\">true</str>\    <str name=\"suggest.count\">50</
❗️ Same changes here as in solrconfig.xml.
❗️ Found it!\https://codice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DDF/pages/6291523/Unit+Testing#UnitTesting-Assertions
❗️ Use an explicitly-typed variable rather than a cast. This ensures a compilation error occurs for any case where an implicit cast is not available (which in theory ensures the operation is a widening conversion though we have cases even in this codebas
✏️  Also need to improve the failure messages for all of the `assertThat` calls. 
✏️  As someone who has updated these things in source code before it was a pain. Can we load it from a resource file? 
✏️  Need to revise the above failure messages for all of the `assertThat` calls to help with troubleshooting. 
✏️  Need a more descriptive test name. I have no idea what this is referring to when it says \"first\" metadata. 
❓ Can we improve that failure message? \```\format(\"Expected an empty map but got %s\" testMap)\```
❓ Does this still need concurrent protection? If another thread invokes this method it will have its own copy of the data structure. 
A bit paranoid probably but what happens if we're missing either of these? We may want to just not show the component / have it return `null` or something since it wouldn't make much sense to show anything here with a number missing. ????‍♂️ 
d'oh this is why we do code reviews.  ????‍♂️ 
✏️ `setup()` (per the DDF unit test standards)
✏️ If we use .60 instead of .6 any coverage error messages will have two digits of precision instead of just one.
❓This test is identical to the previous test except for the test string. Is there any way to verify that the parser failed?

Same as above ☝️ 
❓ Is it ok if the `suggestDictProp` is `null`?

❗️ `assertThat(entries is(empty()))` - no need to create an empty map
❗️ `assertThat(entries is(empty()))` - no need to create empty props

❗️ Need `<scope>provided</scope>`
❗️ `assertThat(entries is(empty()))` - no need to create an empty set
❓ Not sure why this method is needed. I seriously think this is overkill for what we were trying to accomplish. We just needed to extend support for \"karaf.home\" in `AbsolutePathResolver` without adding too much additional functionality. 
❗️ `assertThat(entries is(empty()))` - no need to create an empty set
❓ Can this not be final? 
✅  Much better. Easier to reason about. 
❗️ Should change signature to accept a `Path` as the base for resolution instead of taking system property names. 
❗️ Yeah I understand what you were going for but I can't justify these changes when the base list won't be flexing much if **at all** over the course of time. 
❗️ `assertThat(entries is(empty()))` - no need to create an empty map

I did try to use `response.parsed_body` but it ended up parsing the response as a string even with `as: :json` (`get :bans params: { id: user.id } as: :json`). I just created this helper instead ????‍♂️ 
Until this is stable and has proper test coverage we should add a note to mention to not use this in production yet something like:\`⚠️ THIS ADAPTER IS IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT DON'T USE IN PRODUCTION`
Now there are 100500 usages of `toTemplateHaskellError . Left`. Why not leave `(failText :: Text -> Q a)  = toTemplateHaskellError . Left`? Maybe `failText` is not the best name but other than that such function makes perfect sense to me ????‍♂️

Good opportunity to use a sinon spy? Happy to debate but it will involve coffee ☕️ 
Pinging again... @rwjblue ⬆️   Any thoughts?
Still the issue may be fixed by now it's been a year ????‍♂️ 
Yeah this segmentation obviously doesn't actually do anything but thanks for pointing that out. Might as well have it right if I'm going to bother putting in that comment. ????‍♂️ 
❓ Are media attributes really core to the taxonomy of every metacard? I'm just thinking of all the metacards that will never use them and am curious why these are considered core (They seem very resource specific)
Oh good point. I hadn't planned to change the existing behavior. I probably need more ☕️ . Will update now.

❓ Same comment as for `karaf` about adding comments
❓ I though @oconnormi purposely removed references to ${DDF_HOME} in these files to address another issue about supporting spaces in the DDF_HOME path. @oconnormi ?
❓ why have we removed the start.bat script from being excluded? The script changes are required to properly support error handlers such as oom when DDF is started in the background.
❗️ Equivalent changes will be required to setenv-wrapper.conf and setenv-windows-wrapper.conf

✏️  Should we not move this version in the parent pom along with all others?
Yes those ☝️ 
✏️ Same: non-mock supporting objects would probably be clearer moved to a separate section from the mock generations.
❗️ Missing `<build>` element with `maven-bundle-plugin` and `jacoco-maven-plugin` plugin configs.
✏️ This feels a little fragile depending on the second entry in the audRest. list to be the value you expect. It's a bit cleaner to write this test like this:\```groovy\    def 'add audience to audience restriction with existing audiences'() {\       
❗️ Javadoc. Recommend looking at `SubjectConfirmationPresignPlugin` for a guide on the level/type of information to include here.

Exactly. Block moved. ✅ 
⭕️ This no longer needs to be build scoped. It can just be the \"CachingScriptClassCompiler\". You can probably squash this class and CrossBuildInMemoryCachingScriptClassCache into one.
⭕️ Can you make sure that these things are still covered by other tests? I.e. we make sure that the cross-build cache works and we don't recompile all the time?
⭕️ It doesn't really matter but for symmetry this should return true if both classloaders are null.
❓ What happened here?
❔ Why is the call to `ReplaceNonASCIICharacters` necessary?\\➡️ The use of `ERR_IllegalChar` is intended to avoid the need to write non-ASCII characters to the output. Ironically this does not work as expected due to localization.
❓ the thread safety is more important but just curious if there were any performance concerns with constructing the new WKTReader each time `setViewMetacardActionProvider` is called?
I should probably follow up on that. That was a joke. Please don't obfuscate ✌️ \\I only brought this up because I like clean code. It doesn't bother me _that_ much.

U are right here just realised we have a mix of styles in here. Mostly async/await but there are a few pure promises around. Out of scope ✅

❓ Couldn't we just change all of these hard-coded forward slashes to the `${/}` replacement and avoid the duplication of the `/dev/urandom` perm?
❓ Is this a cross-platform path?
✏️ Nit: I'd prefer if the permissions were grouped together.
✏️ It would help in reviewing and for future upgrades if the changes to this file from its base state were commented.
❓ Same question about all of these file permissions. They should all be subsets of `<<ALL FILES>>` and the perms granted for this `codeBase` to that should be sufficient.
✏️ Should extract this to a factory method possibly on the `ForkJoinPoolFactory` class itself. It seems likely we'll have need for this in other places over time and extracting it out to a method now will make it easier to turn that factory into a common
❓ How much do we care that symbolic name isn't unique? We do a pretty good job of following a naming convention that limits collisions but there's nothing preventing them.
❓ Do we need the complementary `getContextClassLoader` perm?
❗️ This doesn't look like it will allow for rollover logs to be created. Simpler/easier would probably be to allow `readwrite` perms to `${ddf.home.perm}data${/}log${/}-`.\\Also need to update docs w/r/t the security backup log (which should be in a di
❓ In development/testing was DDF deployed to some other directory than under `user.home`?
✏️ Nit: It would be good to group these permissions together. In fact in general if permissions could be sorted where possible it would probably help when reviewing and editing them.
❓ I've forgotten how we're comparing with this `codeBase` for bundle permissions but is there any reason we couldn't change the `file:/` protocol prefix to something more clear like `osgi:`?
❗️ Remove commented line.
❓ Is this long `codeBase` actually a list of code bases separated by the slashes? If so could this be formatted with each separate bundle on its own line and we just remove the whitespace in processing?
❓ What's this permission do? Shouldn't it be covered by `<<ALL FILES>>`?
❓ Do we need the complementary `getContextClassLoader` perm?
❓ Is this enough to allow writing to syslog?
❓ Do we need the complementary `getContextClassLoader` perm?
❓ Doesn't this property permission imply `read` for all other properties already? We shouldn't need `ddf.home` and the two truststore properties to be explicitly called out in that case.
❗️ Javadocs to explain the operation/function of this class.
✏️ Back to my comment in the policy file I suggest we change this to `osgi:`.
I like tap + present.  The string interpolation way was harder for me to grok on first read.  ????‍♂️ 
❓ Are we still using findbugs? I thought we got rid of it.
❓ This doesn't look right. We're creating a new FJP to process the computations and then inside the ctor for the recursive task creating another FJP and ignoring the caller.
✏️ Should extract this to a factory method possibly on the `ForkJoinPoolFactory` class itself. It seems likely we'll have need for this in other places over time and extracting it out to a method now will make it easier to turn that factory into a common
❓ To an empty audience restriction or a non-existing?
✏️  You can do the same in the two test above. Put the `audienceRestriction` in a variable and use it in the `then` block. It seems like you do it everywhere else except those two.
❗️ Fix the capitalization to match our standard.
❓ Was there a change to the coverage? Why did we put `0.59`?
❓ Did you check to see if coverage numbers went up with the transition of the audience restriction work to its own bundle? If so these can be adjusted or removed entirely if all three coverage values are now above .75 + floating point epsilon.
I like this prettyprint format ❤️ 
❓ Should we add or modify any unit tests in `IdpEndpointSpecTest` to account for these changes?
✏️ This is nitpicky but I think we prefer to use `String.format` over String concatentation (`String + String`) for minor performance reasons.
✏️ Could also do \```java\submitFormUpdated =\  submitFormUpdated.replace(String.format(\"{{%s}}\" Idp.RELAY_STATE) relayState != null ? relayState : \"\");\```

✏️  It doesn't look like the javadoc is giving any valuable information. Maybe change it to an `@VisibleForTesting`?
✏️  Annotate the method with `@VisibleForTesting`
Thank you I hate these traces. They are confusing as hell since they don't trace exit from all possible paths.\\❓ Based on what you did below didn't you mean to also remove the entry traces at the beginning of this method?
❓ This will now possibly throw an exception from the auto-close on the input stream whereas before it was ignored. Do we really want to do that? \Closing exceptions on input streams should typically be swallowed.
✏️  Should annotate `contentDisposition` with `@Nullable`
2 lines above it passes `this.username` String as principal. And then it casts the object to `ReverseProxyUserDetails`... ????‍♂️ 
❓ Isn't nullable supposed to be on the parameter instead of the method?

I agree with you!\\Code refactorization done! ☺️ 
????‍♂️ I have no idea why it is `list_create`. Changing it now.\\sure I will put more verbose docstring.
✏️  Move the `if (id == null)` before defining `isFactory` to avoid getting it if not needed
✏️  Replace these the `filter()` and `map()` with `.map(m -> m.get(\"configuration\")).filter(Objects::nonNull)`. This will avoid double hashing/searching in the map.\\Same below for \"bundle_location\"
❗️ This is semantically different. In the original code if this block was skipped because `metatypeService` was null there was still a chance for `returnValues` to be populated (see line 407 of the original code) and then returned.
❓ Could `m -> m.containsKey(\"configurations\"))` be replaced with `Map::containsKey(\"configurations\")`?

❓  Should we even both installing features in different subsystems if this is true? It might be better to just install all features in the root subsystem instead.
❓ This constant looks like it's only being used in a logging statement. The content of the string doesn't look useful either since `Bundle.UNINSTALLED` is an int. Is this constant needed?
❓ Same question as with the `BundleProccessor` would it be worth creating a constructor and having the `FeatureMigrator` pass in these arguments so they don't have to be used as arguments everywhere?
❓ Is there a reason we're passing the bundle context through all of these methods as arguments instead of making a getter for it? It looks like some of the methods in this class aren't using it at all just passing it forward.\\I'm also wondering if it 
❓ Any particular reason for the `\\n` here since using `println`? Formatting?

✏️  annotate `applicationNames` with `@Nullable`
✏️  Could be replace with ```.map(this::getAllDependencyFeatures).forEach(requiredfeatures::addAll)```
✏️  How about a nice little streaming since you now moved the exception handling in that new `tryUninstallfeature()` method?

This is how Bitcoin Core does it ????‍♂️ We could probably also use one of the internal constants to check against; upstream at some point also moved to using strings for identifying parameter types which might also be useful but is out of scope for this

❌ I'd rephrase this and use the term \"declared\" dependencies here to make the distinction from \"resolved\" more obvious. The objects here are completely different from the ones you get in the resolution result. Depending on how the Configuration is resolve
⭕️ \"faced with the challenge\" sounds odd to me - the API makes this super simple :)
❌ Should use implementation/testImplementation not the deprecated compile/testCompile
❌ This dependsOn is counterproductive. Since the task only iterates over the declared dependencies it doesn't need the configuration to be resolved before. This will just make this task run slower than it needs to.
❌  This uses the graph as a flat list which may be better served by the `incoming.artifacts` API in case you also want the artifacts. I think this could be a bit clearer if the example actually showed a graph traversal e.g. printing components at differ
❌ This is overcomplicated and inefficient if you really only want the pom for guava you can just pass the String `com.google:guava:18.0` here. No need to first get the dependency graph (which is very expensive). 
❌ you can implement more complex requirements to your build requiring a \"runtime view\" of dependencies.\\That's a mouthful can we say this simpler?
Another Nitpick: \"must _be_ valid\" ????‍♂️ 
❌ This used to be lazy so it is only computed when we actually log a deprecated feature. Now it is always computed.
❌ Could we overwrite \"outputContains\" in the base class instead of changing every assertion? Paremeterized assertions can be really hard to read.
⭕️ Is this really necessary? I don't see testNG listed here and it works just fine.
❌ The JunitPlatform classes should not extend the old JUnit 4 stuff but be implemented from scratch. Maybe extracting some comonalities into a base class if it saves a lot of code (though I doubt that).
⭕️ Is this using the code that Marc pointed us at for backwards compatibility with the old JUnit report format?
⭕️ What's this used for?
❌ This annotation got lost.
❌ We should not do that as discussed on our call. We should just pass all classes to the worker and let JUnit figure out what is a test.
❌ the engine is only required at runtime so it should be a `testRuntimeOnly` dependency. For the api we should use `testImplementation` because `testCompile` is discouraged.
❌ As discussed on our call JUnitPlatform should aggregate all test classes and only run them in one batch in the `stop` method. This avoids re-running expensive extensions for every test class.
❌ As discussed with the JUnit team every class should be treated as a potential test and the JUnit framework on the worker side will make the decision.

⚠️ Ditto: Added `return true` as reasonable default.
⚠️ ESLint insisted on a return value so I added `return false` based on the existing code and the fact that implicit `return` is `returned undefined ~ return false`.
⚠️ Gotcha I found. Might be good to have exhaustive `switch` / `case` later instead of multiple `if` checks without default case.

❓Should we consider using `Files.list(persistentPath).filter(this::serializedFiles)` instead?

There are actually 2 typos there ????‍♂️ 
❓ Maybe I'm missing something. Can we really remove the `o2 != NsiliClassification.NO_CLASSIFICATION` check here? It seems like that's changing the boolean logic.
❓ Isn't the `StringUtils.isNotBlank` check redundant since it cannot be blank if the first check is true?
❓ Why did we remove the `nsiliAttribute != null` check? Seems like we could be getting an NPE now

✏️  I would prefer not to have a `getHitCount` method and just call `this.model.startSearch({hitCountOnly: true})` here.\\`getHitCount` doesn't align with the verbiage used in `startSearch` so it feels like it's doing an unrelated operation. At first g

❓ Shouldn't the app also depend on `registry-core-api`? \I know that `registry-core` does depend but the point of the app is to install the api and its implementation. For all we know the implementation could be spun up by another app.
❓ Why not remove it completely since it is doing nothing now?
❗️ We should not be removing this command
❗️ Why create a list above and then return a tree set? Why not simply create the tree set above and add to it before returning?
❓ Why the change? This now creates a temporary collection just to stream it.
❓ Shouldn't this be a set?\❗️ Where is it initialized?
✏️ Can be replaced with: \```\return getApplications().stream()\   .map(AppliationNodeImpl::new)\   .collect(Collectors.toCollection(TreeSet::new));\```
❓ Do we still need to keep the `install=\"auto\"`? Looks like it would no longer be used since we are removing apps?
❗️ I don't think we can remove this one. It is required for the profile install and profile list commands.
❗️ What are we replacing this with for HA? This command was used to do 2 things:\- automate installation of defined profiles\- allow installation of customized profiles such as the HA one.
❗️ We should not be removing this command
❓ What is the point in keeping these methods if they do nothing? If not whitelisted I would vote to clean it all up.
❓ Same question as before why are we keeping those? \And if we do should we actually throw an exception indication it is not supported?
❓ Are we also removing profiles? If not then why are we removing this command?
✏️ Avoid searching the map twice with `containKey()` and `get()`\\But the whole method and the following could be replaced with a simple streaming sequence like this:\```\@Override\   public Set<BundleInfo> getBundles() throws ApplicationServiceExcep

❗️ This still seems like the last hack that couples features to apps.  Ideally this should be removed in this PR if possible but a follow up ticket would also be acceptable if it will be too much.
❓ Do all of these really need `-app` in their names?  The same goes for the file name itself.  It all seems redundant since it is already in an `applications` folder.

⭕️ This can probably be refactored so we don't need an additional data object. I.e. first find the identifier you care about then extract its class name and display name. Not a big deal though.

⭕️ We changed to legacy reporting name here - can you point me to the test coverage that comes with this change?
❌ Why do we return the display name here? This method is clearly meant to return the simple name of the class.

please use functions instead of consts when declaring functions ☺️
✏️ Should we be a little more clear on what the `fileCallback` does and when it will be called?
✏️ We should replace `FileWatcher` with `{@link FilesWatcher}` in the comments where appropriate.
✏️ We may want to replace `CDM_FILE_CHECK_PERIOD_PROPERTY` with the actual value or make `CDM_FILE_CHECK_PERIOD_PROPERTY` `public` and use `{@link #CDM_FILE_CHECK_PERIOD_PROPERTY}`.
✏️ Since `destroy()` is `public` do you think we should also make `init()` `public` and have clients call it to get things started?
❓ Can we simply do `this(getPollTimeOrDefault());` here instead?
❓Create `ConcurrentHashMap` where declared instead?
✏️ Nits: Two `>` after the `p`. Can also use `{@link #check()}` instead of `{@code check}`.
❗️Our convention is to assume that nothing can be `null` unless it's annotated with `@Nullable`.
Yeah it's awkward. This was showing a lint moan and if I remove it it complains about \"do not use new for side effects.\" \\Again I'm just twiddling bits as I go. ????‍♂️

❓ Should this be called `productLocation` or `location` instead of `referenceKey`?
✏️ Since this is something we're showing to an administrator we may want to use the configuration name used in the admin console instead of the `URLResourceReader` class name.
❓ Any specific reason we get the sha of the location and use that as the key instead of simply using the location itself?
❓ Do we really need this `null` check here? Can't we just create this when it's declared and not have the `init()` method?
✏️ We should consider changing the `FileSystemPersistenceProvider` class. It currently exposes the `MapLoader` and `MapStore` interfaces which are really implementation details. We should instead be using Hazelcast's `IMap` i.e. `Hazelcast.getMap(...)`
✏️ If we get here and the body isn't a Metacard something is really wrong and we may want to log something.
✏️ `headerValue` instead of `fileName`?
❓ Should we have a constant in `AbstractDurableFileConsumer` for `\"org.codice.ddf.camel.transformer.MetacardUpdateId\"` and use that in both sub-classes?
✏️ Since this is something we're showing to an administrator we may want to use the configuration name used in the admin console instead of the `URLResourceReader` class name.
❓Do we really need the `null` check here? Couldn't we just instantiate the `FileSystemPersistenceProvider` where it's declared and get rid of the `init()` method?
✏️ We need to see if we can put this code in a common place. I've found at least one other place where we have the same exact logic: https://github.com/codice/ddf/blob/master/catalog/core/catalog-core-standardframework/src/main/java/ddf/catalog/impl/opera
✏️ If we can have only one `getMetacardIdFromReference()` method we should also have common `CATALOG_CREATE` `CATALOG_UPDATE` and `CATALOG_DELETE` constants and use those everywhere instead of hard-coding the values.
✏️ We should increase the coverage when we port that PR.
❓ Is this code the same as `DurableFileAlterationListener. getMetacardIdFromReference()`? If so we should try to see if we can share that code.
✏️ Should we also compare the values if the attribute already exist and at do something if they don't match? For instance if the file name or resource URI is different something is probably really wrong and we should consider just stopping the processin
✏️ Since `null` is not an instance of anything we only need the `serializable instanceof String` part in the condition.
❓ Since the threading and subject are only needed when we're ready to call the catalog framework should we change the route in the in-place scenario and only add those after the `choice()` right before the `.to(catalog:framework)`?
❓ Any specific reason we get the sha of the location and use that as the key instead of simply using the location itself?
✏️ Since this method is meant to be used by sub-classes we should make it `protected`.
❓Any reason we use the mime type in the header before the `transformerId`? Just curious because before the `transformerId` took precedence over the `mimeType` argument.
❓ Should we rename to `ExchangeBuilder` and update the JavaDoc?\❓ Should we make `protected` since this isn't meant to be used outside sub-classes?
❓ Do we need to worry about getting a `TypeConversionException` here?
✏️ We may want to keep things consistent between all the `onFile*()` methods and either always use a variable called something like `productLocation` instead of `referenceKey` or calling `entry.getLocation()` multiple times.
✏️ We should use `Collections.emptyList()` instead of creating a `new ArrayList<Metacard>()` every time.\Same comment applies a few more places below.
✏️ When we port this to master we need to find a better way to define and expose these constants. It feels like they should be defined as `public` here or in some kind of API bundle so that other components know what headers need to be set.
❓ Do we really need the `isEmpty` check here? The `for` won't have anything to loop over and should be automatically be skipped.
✏️ We should consider making all the member variables constructors and methods meant to be used by sub-classes `protected` instead of just package-private.
✏️ Should we extract the ternary operator from the `for` statement?
❓ Do we need to care about any potential https://static.javadoc.io/org.apache.camel/camel-core/2.20.2/src-html/org/apache/camel/TypeConversionException.html exception here?
❓ Are we sure that all our headers will always be `String`? For instance couldn't `Exchange.FILE_LENGTH` be an `Integer`? Could we just check it's not `null` and do `headerValue.toString()` instead?
✏️ Add `@Nullable` on the `file` parameter.
✏️ When we port to master we should add all the proper `@Nullable` annotations or `null` checks where it makes sense.
❓ Should we call this method `build()` instead?

⭕️ That's the default.
⭕️ There is a lot of coupling in these methods - If I add a test number \"4\" in the tests above it won't actually be checked because this is hard-coded to check 1 2 and 3. Should probably be a shared constant that all these methods use.

❌ This comment doesn't really help me understand the problem. Why do I need suite events for this test?
❌ Please don't make the scanner more complicated. Use a decorating test class processor instead.
⭕️ We don't need to show every possible combination. Just show the ones that actually have an important use case like \"I want to run just this test\".
❌ We are missing some explanations what the differences are. Maybe we should also reduce the number of examples to a few recommended ones to make it easier to understand. Right now I'd just be very confused when reading this.
⭕️ Where do we still use Property?
❌ This test is basically just testing the TAPI which is unnecessary as it already has tests in Gradle core.
❌ Almost none of the packages below are part of the tooling API. We should only export the ones that are actually part of the official API.
❌ I'm a bit confused by the whole setup. Why is the TAPI jar checked in? Shouldn't that be the job of the build to set up the project?

Not important at this stage but ✂️ 
I guess all of these specs talk about rendering but I expect that to search for `className`s or HTML or text. I'm guessing they're a remnant of when this was part of the old tests but it might be nice to tweak them. ????????‍♂️
You should always add a new line on the end of your files ☝️ github is not a fan of that as you can see...
☝️ why is this initiating from `super.to_s` when attribute is empty?  If I'm not wrong `BigDecimal.new(super.to_s)` will result in `ArgumentError (invalid value for BigDecimal(): \"\")` when that attribute it empty.
❌ This should be two different classes (simple name pattern qualified name pattern).
❌ This logic should live in the TestClassPattern classes.
`find_by` returns `nil` if not found `find` raises an exception ????‍♂️ \\Don't have a strong opinion on this.

I was wondering why they weren't saved... ????‍♂️ 
Up to you - if there's an explicit \"conform to #52\" somewhere (or one can be created) then it's for sure OK to wait - if you want to pick it off now that's fine too? ❤️ 
You described tested method ✔️ described what parameters it got ✔️ but did not describe expected outcome ❌  (fix missing parameter or outcome description everywhere ????)

❌ Why did the library count increase?
❓ Do we have any cases for this to be a service?
❗️ These javadocs need to be updated for both methods in this interface. Ideally they'd include a short example of showing the Builder and exactly what information they need to give to the builder.
✏️ Same comment as above. Don't pass in these arguments everywhere.
✏️ I'd throw something like an `UnsupportedOperationException` to make it clear that this is just a workflow that we don't support yet. I did that same thing for when we fail to decode using `DEFLATE` encoding. Technically they could use some other type o
❗️ We should make all setters protected so that only the builders can access them if we can. We don't want them manually changing these properties. Not sure if a class that's internal to the subclass will be able to access them ???? 
❗️ You are not setting this in the `PostLoginTest`.\❓  This is nitpicky but I want this `isRelayStateGiven` property to be `protected` according to my other comments. So my initial thought is to put the set operation in the `IdpResponse` builders and we
✏️ I think we just missed these but these methods don't need to have anything passed in. The methods should just access the `response` directly since it's a property that is set on this object.
I have no idea why ????‍♂️.  The debug apk has ~45000 references still on API Level 19 I got ClassNotFoundExceptions until I enabled multidexing. I don't have time to dig deeper and it's just the example app.
❗️ After thinking about this approach more I think this will lead to clients leaking open resource streams on the content items if the content items are not passed to the catalog framework or manually closed by the caller.
Wohoo feature switch! ❤️ ???? 
This will add a trailing slash to all routes that don't automatically have one. But as for why... ????‍♂️
Oh this is sweet I like it ❤️
still missing a space ☺
❓ Why is this `GetAncestor`? I'm concerned that in a nested expression scenario this could provide incorrect results.
I ❤️ that this is such a short sleep because I'm compulsive about keeping tests as fast as possible
Yeah I removed those because they didn't work in the test ????‍♂️ 
✏️ No need to pass the `response` down to the functions; they would already have access to the final `response` field on the class. They should also both be private.
✏️ Optionally:\```kotlin\            val idpResponse = getServiceProvider(IdpResponder::class.java).getIdpRedirectResponse(response).apply {\                isRelayStateGiven = true\            }\```
✏️ Consider:\```kotlin\        return IdpRedirectResponse.Builder().apply { \            httpStatusCode(response.statusCode)\            url(REDIR_REGEX.find(script)?.groups?.get(1)?.value)\        }.build()\```
✏️ Might consider a slightly more professional message here...something like \"This condition should never occur.\" perhaps.
✏️ Method can be private.
✏️ Same comment as in `PostVerifier` regarding private methods and not passing the `response` param.
✏️ Method can be private.
✏️ Same comment as above w/r/t using `apply` function.
❗️ Never used.
✏️ Method can be private.
✏️ This might be better now that it takes an `IdpResponse` and not a `String` to make an extension function on `IdpResponse`. Then callers would invoke `myIdpResponse.buildDom()`.
✏️ Options:\1. Just use the `response.X` values directly in the call below to `SimpleSign().validateSignature`\2. Wrap the call to `SimpleSign().validateSignature` with a `with(response)` block.\\I think the latter might actually read a bit clumsy (bu

Sadly no; the ✔️ or ❌ is different depending on availability.
Eww that's gross ????. As I was curious I investigated a bit more so that would be ❤️ if that comment said \"NSTask internally parses its arguments using -fileSystemRepresentation which chokes on \\0 we must […]\".
❗️ Could you manually test this message by forcing it? If IntelliJ is any indication this will print out the `response` variable value and then the word `.sigAlg`.
❗️ This should be removed
✏️ nit: capital P in `IdP`\(4 different places in this interface)
✏️ Instead of a null test here and on line 142 could change the types of `samlResponseNode` and `relayStateNode` to `Optional<Node>` remove the `orElse(null)` calls at the end of the streams and then test on `if (samlResponseNode.isPresent())` etc.
✏️ Same comment about replacing the not-null & equals tests with a single equals test where you invert the inputs. 
✏️ While the Google Java format does allow single-line if/else/etc. blocks without braces we do not do that in Java code.
✏️ `(SAML_RESPONSE.equals(node.attributes.get(NAME)))` will simplify your test.
✏️ The normal use of a fluent builder in Java would be more like this:\```java\return new IdpPostResponse.Builder()\    .httpStatusCode(exampleStatusCode)\    .samlForm(exampleSampleForm)\    .build();\```
❓ Is there value to holding these other representations at this level or will they be moved to a decorator at some point?
don't forget those `return` statements ❤️ 
I changed it to \"classic or application load balancer\" to be a bit more concise but if you feel strongly it should be \"classic load balancer or application load balancer\" I will update it.\✅

Lotsa commented-out stuff here. Did you mean to remove it? Perhaps leftovers from the source template? Time to break out the ✂️?
✂️ this function too?
❓Could we do something like `return Arrays.stream(conditions).allMatch(c -> c.isSatisfied())` instead?
❗️ We're missing many conditions and paths here that would be really difficult to test higher up. We should mock out the value returned by `bundle.getSignerCertificates(Bundle.SIGNERS_TRUSTED)` and test all the paths and cases in `isSatisfied()` `getExte
❓ Don't we need a test where the `Subject` has more principals than needed i.e. `testIsSatisfiedWithExtraPrincipals()`?
❓ Shouldn't we check that the result is cached?
✏️ `testIsSatisfiedWithPrincipalMissing()`?
❗️Instead of disabling the whole plugin here we should try to find why checkstyle fails on those imports and fix its configuration or silence those individual errors instead: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4023185/how-to-disable-a-particular-checks
❗️We should update the description of all the `AbstractCondition` sub-classes they all refer to `The interface implemented by a Condition` and all say the same thing. Explaining what they are checking instead would be really useful.
❗️ We should add a test where one `BundleNameCondition.isSatisfied()` returns `true` and the other returns `false`.
✏️ `testIsSatisfiedWithAllPrincipals()`?
❓ Does this prove that the condition result was cached or just that the class returns consistent results? Should we consider adding a package-private getter to get the cache `Map` or a way to inject it so we can actually verify that the entry was prope
❗️ We're not caching anything if `conditionInfo.getArgs()` is empty so this assertion is a little misleading.
❓ Since `isSatisfied(Condition[] Dictionary)` is defined in `AbstractCondition` and doesn't really care about the actual `Condition` implementation should we put those tests in a separate `Test` class instead of making them look like they're `BundleName
❓Do we really need to pre-allocate 100000 entries in that map? Seems pretty large.

❓ If this gets applied to all metacards (genericized) I wonder if we could roll this in with our other policy impls somehow.
❗️ To be truly generic these attributes need to be incorporated into the types in catalog-core-api. That includes following all of our other taxonomy conventions and working through ramifications for other potential sharing types. See overall review comm
❗️ If this is truly generic then all metacards are potentially shareable just like with `security.access-individuals|groups`.
❓ We probably wouldn't need this wrapper or maybe this entire class if we incorporate sharing into catalog-core-api.

✏️ There's no reason to use raw strings here.
✏️ Can simplify this function and remove the mutable list by\Firstly getting rid of the two URI consts and replacing with\```kotlin\        private val RWEDC_URI_SET = setOf(\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.0:action:rwedc-negation\"\                \"urn:oa

❓ Should this be renamed to `canShare` since we're moving to a model where most (if not all) metacards support sharing as long as they have security attributes? Also for the time being `ShareableMetacard` might be more like a \"decorator\" which provides 
❓ Since technically all metacards should be shareable we might want to limit the constructors in `ShareableMetacardImpl` to the variants that only take an existing metacard. In that case it would become more of a `ShareableMetacardDecorator` of sorts. T
❓ Can we come up with a substitute for tagging since when this stuff moves to `core` it would result in a lot of unnecessary state? 
❗️ You can get rid of this `bean` and the metacard type `bean` since nobody is using them. They are just hanging out in the blueprint container and not being injected anywhere.

❓ Is this going away in favor of security attributes? 
❓ Can we get rid of the security tag on this iteration?

✏️ `wpip`? How about `preingestPlugin` or just `plugin` instead? 
❓ Can this be removed since it's already being injected by `Core` attributes? 
❓ My guess is we just add the useful functions & tools from this class onto `MetacardImpl` itself? 
❓ Just realized that email may not be the only valid unique key for identifying users so we may need a subsequent step. I wonder if we can punt fulfilling that requirement to another ticket. 
✏️  This javadoc comment is out of date
❓ If we're moving toward the notion that all metacards could support sharing does this constructor make sense anymore? 
❗️ You're caching the metacard type but the default `MetacardImpl` already has the state for handling that. You might experiences inconsistencies in type resolution. I would recommend either: \1. Rely on the `ShareableMetacardImpl(Metacard MetacardType)
❗️ Can probably remove since nobody uses the duplicated descriptor state in `ShareableMetacardImpl` but the descriptor state that lives in `MetacardImpl`.

❓ We should verify passing `security.tag.is-shareable` as the type name is acceptable. I think it's fine since we are incubating in `catalog-ui-search` for now and are not publishing this type in the blueprint container. @brendan-hofmann what do you think

@damassi do you have any ideas on ☝️? 
✏️ Could move this line to be the first in the closure so it can short-circuit finding the index and notOnOrAfter values.
✏️ Streaming alternative (I personally prefer the foreach):\```\if (nodes.stream().anyMatch {\            isNullNamespace(it) ||\                    (isSamlNamespace(it) && !expectedSamlNames.contains(it.localName))\        })\    throw SAMLComplian

☝️ won't work cause allChildren doesn't need you to pass a String. But I'm not sure what you mean by all attributes. What it does is iterate through the response and see if we have Nodes like\```\<saml2:AttributeValue xsi:type=\"xsd:string\">guest</saml2:

❓Why did we need this on top of the URI again? Shouldn’t the URI be globally unique?
❓Should we throw an `InvalidArgumentException` if the same listener is added twice?
❓I’m not sure how strict we can be here. There’s always a chance that an `Harvester` ends up sending the same event twice to a its listeners no matter what so we may want to change this to say that it is best effort and put a constraint on the listeners 
❓Experimental? Same for all the other new interfaces.

❓Did we consider extending `Resource` instead?
❗️ Since most of the `HarvestedResource` methods will not return anything useful (`null` most likely which would force us to add `@Nullable` on a lot of its methods just for this case) we should consider passing in only the unique ID and/or the URI of t
❓To avoid the above problems should we just allow a single listener and assume it’s always the same one that registers and unregisters?
❓Should we leave this out of the interface until we know for sure we need it?
❓Any reason we’re returning `null` instead of throwing an exception?\❗️If we must return `null` we should add the `@Nullable` annotation.

✏️ `The administrator can control user access to ingest and metadata in ${catalog-ui}.`
✏️ `By default the uploader is shown to users and editing is allowed.`
✏️ This might be a little clearer if it was just a void method that set the qualifier on the `resourceURI` argument. Or maybe renaming the method to something like `createUriWithQualifier` could work too.

❌ This is not safe double checked locking requires the field to be volatile. Same in the method below. Otherwise another thread could see a half-instantiated task.
❌ getSource is currently private and undocumented.
❌ This is not true. Tasks will always be run. I think we should remove this paragraph and instead explain task execution later when we add the \"upToPhase\" concept. Also let's not call out the possibility of mutating the start parameters in the model build

☝️ just realised this is a fib. I was thinking of implementing it like this but never got round to it.
Why are tests being commented out❓ 
`modelIndex` might not be the best name for this function anymore - it just turns a non-primitive into a number for cacheing purposes.  ????‍♀️ 
✏️ A `let` is fine here but an `apply` might be a little cleaner.
✏️ It reads a little oddly to me to test `all` `isEmpty`. Not that `none` `isNotEmpty` is that much better but the use of none matches up with the \"not found\" a bit more I think.
❓ Do we need to protect against the case where there are no status code nodes?
✏️ `response.attributes` is accessed here without safe nav. So either it is safe (and the safe accesses on lines 56 76 and 91 don't need to be safe) or it will throw an NPE and it and the accesses on lines 64 and 74 need to be safe as well.
❓ I wonder if the base class should be renamed to `ProtocolResponseVerifier` or even just `ResponseVerifier` so the structure of its name matches its concrete subclasses.

✏️ Could split the conditional `nameIdPolicyFormat == null` test out and then move these two lines into it. That would short-circuit looking these up.

✏️ Could also more generically declare these params as `Iterable<Node>`. There's no value in that for a private function but we should probably be more aware of it in general.
✏️ Kotlin collections override the `==` operator so if you could ensure the two lists contained the same data _in the same order_ or simply converted the lists to sets you could simplify the condition below:\```kotlin\        val reqAttributes = reqId
✏️ Instead of using a mutable list I think you'll find this reads a little more cleanly like this:\```kotlin\        val subjectList = response.children(\"Assertion\")\                .flatMap { it.children(SUBJECT) }\                .toList()\\

❗️ I thought we decided you didn't need two nested loops here and that you could just do one pass.
✏️ For this line and the usage above you can just call `filterNotNull()` instead of `filter { it != null }`.
✏️ If it fits on one line it could look cleaner as:\```\issuer = IssuerBuilder().buildObject().apply { value = SP_ISSUER }

❓ Could we use Guava's `ImmutableMap.of(SecurityConstants.SECURITY_SUBJECT SECURITY.runAsAdmin(SECURITY::getSystemSubject))`?
❓ Should we throw the exception straight from `harvestedResourceTransformer.transformHarvestedResource(resource)` instead of checking for `null` and throwing here?
❓Should we throw an exception or return an empty `Optional` if we can't transform instead of returning `null`?
❓ Why not return the `Optional` and let the `public` top level `transform` methods decide what to do? Would save a few `null` checks along the way.
❓ Do we really need to create another `TemporaryFileBackedOutputStream` here and make a copy again? We've already done that before calling this method (L86).
❓Should we set the checksum and checksum algo attributes as well here?
❗️To make sure we don't forget we should add a service property where we register the metacard-only `StorageAdaptor` and use a filter here to get the right one. Otherwise this could return the wrong one when we have two of them registered.

❗️ Many test methods test more than one thing and should be broken up.
✏️ Don't think those work with the Google code formatter. Should we remove them?
❓ Don't think we need this since the test will fail if no exception is thrown.
✏️ `private` method at the bottom?
❓ Should we extract and reuse those instead of creating new anonymous inner classes every time?
❓ Can we remove?
✏️ Since we're getting a `DateTime` in should we remove the word `Now` from their names and maybe name the argument `time` instead of `now`?
❗️ Break up test methods.
❓ Should we assert all of them not just the first one?
✏️ Feels weird that the argument is called `now` but could be any `DateTime` really.\❓ Also should we add something about the location being Flagstaff in the method name or actually take in a location?
❗️ Should we extract a class that takes in a few parameters instead of creating those new anonymous inner classes everywhere?
❗️ This should be broken up into separate tests.
❓ Should we change the name to indicate that we're testing wildcard on ID not a specific ID?
❓ Could we use JUnit's `TestName` rule instead of parsing the stack trace and relying on a potentially wrong index?
❓ Can we add the word `Test` somewhere in the name of the classes that extend `SolrProviderTestBase` and contain `@Test` methods? If we get rid of the suite then we could just add `Test` at the end.
❓ Would it be worth having a couple of `private` methods to save and restore system properties i.e. something like `saveSystemProperty()` that could be used here and `restoreSystemProperty()` in the `tearDown()`?
❓ Any reason we're taking in a `SolrCatalogProvider` instead of using the existing `provider` member variable like we do in the other methods?
❓ Since all those polygons aren't really readable and make the test code a little messy should we consider putting them in external test resource files and just read them in?
✏️ Move `private` methods at the bottom.
❓ Stream?
I'd write this as an arrow function so we avoid writing `.bind(this)`.\Writing non-lifecycle methods as arrows automatically binds the function with the instance so `this.renderSquare` is well defined (magic ✨)

❓ Why was the comparison to the`acsUrl` taken out?
✏️ `getLocation` sounds odd when calling it from a post response. Maybe `getDestination` instead?
✏️ Super nitpick: we don't use acronym variable names a lot in the codebase. Probably more consistent to change `si` to `serviceInfo` or something of that manner instead.
✏️ Instead of making 1 line private methods could just call `getACS` directly.
❓ Is there any reason for the ordering of `ByUrl` `ByIndex` and `ByProtocolBinding` when trying to obtain the `acsUrl`?
❓ I wonder if it might be clearer/better if we added a specific case for artifact binding even though it would just do the same as the else branch.

❓Since `newCloudSolrClient` is already marked `@VisibileForTesting` do we need to make this one `@VisibleForTesting` too?

❓Couldn't we use `solr_data_dir` here instead of using a different `data_dir` variable?
❓Since we're not expecting the exception message to be shown to the end user are we being too strict here by failing if it changed?
❓Could we inject the `RetryPolicy` instead of having to make this method `@VisibileForTesting` and sub-class to replace it?
❓ Separate test?
❓Should we check that `core` isn't `null` before creating the `SolrClientAdapter` instead of relying on its constructor to fail?
❓ Instead of having to deal with these issues (and the `isAvailable()` stuff below) could we provide a `Supplier<SolrClientAdapter>` to the `SolrCloudClientFactory` instead so we can return a `SolrClientAdapter` that bypasses all the threading issues?

✏️ If you use methods instead of closures you can provide default values for the parameters. A use case could be that instead of passing `\"urn:samlconf:fail\"` to most of these closures you can just call the method with not arguments.

✏️ We can change this to `3.1.4`
Given this option we should prompt the user for confirmation as it’s a non-reversible action! ⚠️
✏️ API should not be in the package name.  For example interfaces would go in `org.codice.ddf.catalog.ui.forms` and implementations would be in `org.codice.ddf.catalog.ui.forms.impl`.
❓ Type checking/casting is going to create a lot of tech debt for us if we ever want to extract any of this functionality for more general use. Have you considered the decorator pattern instead?
❓ Could you just call `SystemBaseUrl.getBaseUrl()` instead?
❗️ I think we should wait for [DDF-3817](https://codice.atlassian.net/browse/DDF-3817) instead of this workaround.
❓ Should these be javadoc?
✏️ If we're not going to fill out these annotations why bother adding them?
✏️  Could use a more meaningful description here
✏️ might help readability extracting this method out to a separate method
✏️ we could log `DEFAULT_FILE_EXTENSION`
✏️ With the way our tests report out I'm not sure there's any value in this (or similar) debug messages. We already report their names.
❓ I'm not clear what information is being shared across the backchannel. `true` then `false`? That doesn't hold much semantic meaning.
✏️ Instead of creating this in all cases use lazy delegation...\```kotlin\val secondRequest by lazy {\  createDefaultAuthnRequest(binding DSA_SP_ISSUER DSA_SP_ENTITY_INFO)\}\```
✏️ Should be no reason for this if/else; a single param pair of `key=value` will process just fine if passed to the code in the `if` block.
❓ What are these two repos and why do we need them added?
✏️ Might want to rename to `requestString`
✏️ Up on line 124 not sure why we're using the Guava `Splitter` over kotlin std functionality.
✏️ Same comment about collapsing the else clause away because with or without the second param the logic of the if block is sufficient.
✏️ Perhaps we should break up this class into smaller more manageable units.
✏️ Might want to rename this val to `samlElement`

✏️ Putting this comment here before reading further at the usages of this method: This is a very weird way to determine whether it's SSO or SLO. From this method's perspective why wouldn't SSO have a responseDom?

❗️ We need to verify that all of these (minus relay state) are **not** null. See `RedirectBindingVerifier.verifyNoNulls`. ???? that method could be reused if we change the method to just take a url string and if we change this SPVerifier method to take the
✏️ If you address my comment about casting to `StatusResponseType` you can just call `postBindingVerifier.verifyXmlSignatures` instead of doing it manually here.
✏️ space after the `httpResponse` parameter.
✏️ Nit: Could we do `postBindingVerifier.verifyXmlSignatures` **then** `postBindingVerifier.verifyPostDestination`? That would line up with PostBindingVerifier better.
✏️ Alternative to explicitly checking for the `LogoutResponse` name in the dom:\```\val responseObject = OpenSAMLUtil.fromDom(docElement) as\    StatusResponseType\```
✏️ You could use `by lazy` here to avoid creating the authnRequest if only logging in one SP.
❗️ Technically this is not a requirement if we ever implement Artifact binding. I think we should either put a TODO here for if we ever implement Artifact binding or have the tests call this directly instead. I'm leaning towards the latter because then we
✏️ Might be good to put a comment explaining why the random \"a\" is here.
✏️ Kind of out of scope but could you rename this to `samlResponseObject` in an effort to continue to differentiate between HTTP response and SAML response?

✏️ Should the name be changed to reflect that this is a POST specific method?

❓ Should the constructor be taken out? Making two objects one for the CTK and one for the second SP doesn't seem too inefficient.
❗️❓ Should we be verifying the second response as well?
❓ `getServiceProvider` sounds confusing to me. Since we have multiple `SP Endpoints` now I would assume that this method is supposed to return one of those endpoints or something. Instead it returns the correct plugin portion.\\An alternative could be 
❓  Should the name reflect that this method decodes as well?
❓ Do we need `paramMap`? Can't we just use `queryParameters`?
✏️ Can combine the declaration and try block:\```\val decodedRelayState = try {\    URLDecoder.decode(encodedRelayState StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name())\} catch ...\```
❓ ✏️ Should this methods live somewhere else instead? Maybe in `ServiceProviderEndpont.kt`?
❓ Why is this id created differently than the id in `createDefaultAuthnRequest()`?
❓ Should `singleSP` be a system property or something rather than a flag here? It seems like having multiple SP's is/will be big enough factor in the tests to be globally referenced.
❗️ When this is called from `ServiceProviderEndpointVerification` is it checking the wrong SP endpoint (the default one)?
❓ Will we ever want to have the second SP send the initial LogoutRequest? If so it may require a little bit of a refactor.
❓ What is the purpose of the statement inside of the parenthesis?
❓ ❗️ Should the issuer in this case be the second SP? If so `currentSPIssuer` only gets changed to the second SP during the tests that need to use the DSA signature.
❓ What is the purpose of making the lines shorter?
✏️ Could put this at the top of the function to short circuit as soon as possible.
❓ What was the purpose of taking these out?
❗️  Should this also test that hitting the endpoints writes true/false to the file as well?
❗️ When this is called from `ServiceProviderEndpointVerification` is it checking the wrong SP endpoint (the default one)?
❓ Why are we getting rid of the `--` options?
And a minor note:  Best tech-writing practice is to use the full term \"Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX)\" here because it's the first time the term is used.  But if that makes the sentence confusing or too long it's probably okay to use \"SGX\" here
❓ Can we fast-path this for the case where the delegate is not contained within a generic type? I believe that would cover the vast majority of delegates so I'm envisioning this:\\```csharp\var delegateContainingType = delegateType.ContainingType;\if
❗️ My feelings for using exceptions as flow control aside this log statement is forgot to include the exception `e`.
✏️ RuntimeException extends Exception - so since the two blocks are identical you can get rid of this one. 
✏️  I'm not gud at maths but i think this is only going to get to 4 seconds with the `maxRetries` set to 2. We could make them line up if we wanted.\✏️  Why are we retrying to execute as system subject here? It seems odd to have it here instead of actual
✏️ This could be moved down after all these null checks that short circuit this method so we do not waste any unneeded cycles on this method. It would also help readability if it appeared before it was being used instead of 20 lines before. 
✏️  Just personal preference and for posterity Still think it would be cleaner to reduce the nesting here and invert this runWhenNotGuest and not have to pass in the checkedsupplier and such. 
❓ Should this be whatever the systems unique identifier is instead of just `system`?\❓ is it okay to have system as the default owner if there was no owner on the metacard?
❓/ ✏️   if we added the `CheckedSupplier` can't we get rid of `this::safeGetBody` and use the endpointutil one directly?
????‍♂️ Not sure if it improves the legibility but could also be: `props[clientNav ? \"to\" : \"href\"] = href;`
????‍♂️ Is \"color\" even the right term to use? intent? type? are we using color on mobile?
???? This should probably be removed right?\\????‍♂️ It might be worth replacing this with something like `export type ValidSemanticColors = \"default\" | \"destructive\";` and then you can use that in your button code.
✏️ I actually would prefer having it in one class so I can see everything this is doing as a whole.  As well as what ben said does seem a little heavyweight for only being used once. 
Which name would you prefer since you were the original ✍️ of `nodeTiming` ;) https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/3187#discussion_r136454948
❓ Can we use the unique identifier for workspace operations too? This `getSubjectEmail` method expects the user's email to have an attribute key of `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress` which may not be the case. If it were
Oops. That's the second issue with the proposed text we've seen ????‍♂️

super nit: I would have kept the capitalization of `iDEAL` consistent between `SourceParams.createIdealParams` and the name of the test - but I'm just now noticing that the test above this also uses `IDeal` so ????‍♂️ 
❓ This class is a pain to test ☹️ I wonder what's better here. Make all of those methods `@VisibleForTesting` and have to extend the class to override them or inject `Supplier<>` instances and mock those out.
✏️ Any reason this is on a separate line (same comment for the next two constants)?
✏️  Just a nitpick but after seeing this it seems like naming it `WaitAction` would be a little more generic since it handles both `waitTo` and `waitFor`
❓ It looks like a lot of the places calling methods are already synchronized is there a reason we are doing it here as well.

The funny/sad thing is that Meteor is actually responsible for the camel-casing [here](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/4e59d8bb6514c718960b69a46abda591b3390c19/packages/webapp/webapp_server.js#L116). ????‍♂️ 
I borrowed some of this style from the [\"Getting Started\" pipelines tutorial pages](https://pipelines.lsst.io/getting-started/index.html) since it presently exists in a somewhat odd space between topic-based docs and a well tutorial. ????‍♀️ 
I hadn't seen that! I updated my `KEYMAP`s to be the new pretty format (see current PR version) ✨.
❓ Is there a reason you didn't just call `entityServiceInfo.getUrl()`?
I don't think I've seen straight lorem ipsum in Stories.  Is there a sample question with responses we could use? ????????‍♀️
❓How much do we gain by threading this out i.e. would it be acceptable for `isAvailable()` to simply block when we need to ping Solr? That would simplify the logic the code and the tests.
❓Same question as the one on L365.
✏️ Typo: `are thrown back` instead of `or thrown back`?
❓Instead of having 4 constructors `@VisibleForTesting` should we just have one and let the test deal with the boilerplate code?
❓Since we don't expect `close()` to be called multiple times or in a loop is it still worth having this extra check here? Should we just rely on the one on L319-321 since that second one is needed no matter what?
❓Do we need to call `lock.notifyAll()` here to make sure threads waiting on the lock don't get stuck or time out?
❓Threading out the calls to the listeners (and initializers) is safer but makes the code and tests more complex. Did we have a strong case for doing this at this time? Could we make it synchronous now and if we need it in the future extract some kind of

I actually had that doubt as well. I'll leave it to @yangshun & @joelmarcey to decide ☺
it's still not working locally but... ????‍♂️  ????‍♂️  
Yep not the resolution but the window size. This if really confusing I never get the differences between all these... However we can add it in another PR ????‍♀️ 
Maybe we can just call it `resolution`. Also I would explicitly pass the width and height. ????‍♀️ 
⭕️ Just a stylistic comment: I generally prefer a quick return instead of a long nested if.
⭕️ This relies on no more than a second passing between here and the last assertion I guess? Probably reasonable but a safer approach would be passing a clock into the cache and letting it use the time from that clock instead of calling the static curren
⭕️ I guess the performance tests will tell us whether this is going to be a problem :)
⭕️ Is there something we could reuse instead of having this test introduce its own transform and checking all the files ids and components (which are not the topic of this test)?
⭕️ We should consider cleaning up empty folders at some point.
⭕️ I prefer well-named extracted methods over inline comments as the latter go stale quickly.
⭕️ This may read clearer if it was also a constant and the cleanup constant was derived from it.
⭕️ Guava has `Files.touch`.
in our team we call these methods `providesXyz` - doesn't matter much though ????‍♀️ 
I figured that made the line a bit long (91 chars) but PEP 257 doesn't say anything about line lengths. ????‍♂️

Maybe `ui-icon-closethick` instead to mirror the ✖s in the tracker list?
For some weird reason a few of our deps pull in this types package as a runtime dependency which leads to there being multiple versions… It’s really a bug upstream but whatevs can’t fight every battle ????‍♂️

❓ Just to clarify we don't call `getImplementation` here because we are already logged in and when we send our second request we don't have to \"login\" again right?
✏️ Alternatively you can use `response.localName` to get the non-namespaced node name:\```\val nodeName = response.localName\```
✏️ Should this be \"Attempts to login service providers\" instead?
❓ Can you explain what this does for me? After googling it only takes me to the kotlintest github and I'm too lazy to actually try to figure it out ????.
✏️ Even though this name looks super pretty being the same character length as the above val the variable makes more sense to me if it is named `samlMessageFormControl` instead.

@wohali I already did all that in 22e8f97 ;) Your description of the standard practice sounds like a good one to me. In this case upstream doesn't actually have any tags (????‍♂️) so I picked `X.Y.Z` optimistically as `2.2.0` ????

❓Can we make those `log...` methods `private` and remove the annotation? Doesn't look like they're used outside this class.
❓This comment doesn't look right in this commit but I think it's fine in the latest one.
❓Think there would be a problem with making this method and `hasInitializers()` `public`? I think it would make sense from an API perspective.
❓Is this used anywhere outside this class? I couldn't find any references to it. If not we should remove the annotation and make it `private`.
✏️ Really wish we didn't have to expose so many methods as `@VisibleForTesting`. It tightly couples the tests with the implementation and will make the tests really brittle down the road.
❓How much rework would it be to extract a `SolrPingClient` class that would hide and manage all the ping logic i.e. keep track of the `lastPing` provide a `wasNotRecent()` method etc. instead of having all that logic in this class?
❓Do we really need this check here? Even if `now == previous.get()` which is unlikely the logic should still work fine afaict.
❓Can't clearly follow all the code paths and logic leading to this point so I'm not sure wether this is a problem or not but could we end up notifying initializers at the wrong time? Looks like the `available` flag would prevent that but couldn't the s

❓Can we improve the description to make it clear that these tests are verifying that the adaptor recovers from an initial failure?

✏️ It's a question of style/preference and I don't feel strongly about it but this condition might read more cleanly if the more complex second test were extracted to a private fun.
❓ Is the structure\```\<status...>\    <statuscode...>\        <statuscode...>\```\? Am I just reading this condition completely wrong?
????‍♂️ Can we use one of our standard colors?

????‍♂️ Huh - is that really the best solution to this with flex box? That seems surprising.
????‍♂️ I think it would be better to pass in the router itself so that we're not dependent on the shape of the context object. Or even better just have it pass in a boolean if the router is available (since we're not using it anywhere anyway).
????‍♂️ What's the best way to view this stuff? When I visit https://deploy-preview-106--wonder-blocks.netlify.com/demo I get a 404 error. Is there anyway we can deploy the demo so that we can test it?
Yes ☝️ is the structure

❗️We need tests to make sure the plugin doesn't fail when exceptions are thrown in `handleProcessCreateItem()` and `handleProcessUpdateItem()`.
✏️ If we make changes to the description in the metatype file we should update this description as well.
❗️We need tests for the overview resizing to make sure `calculateOverviewHeight()` and `calculateOverviewWidth()` as expected.
❓Not sure if it's possible but it'd be good to test the `IOException`s being thrown in `renderImage()` `renderImageUsingOriginalDataModel()` `addThumbnailToMetacard()` `createDerivedImage()` and `createOriginalImage()`.
❗️We should also have a test to make sure `processDelete()` doesn't do anything when called with a non-null `ProcessRequest`.

✅ Nice that you check to make sure that `num` has a valid starting value.
✅ Very nice use of making different datatypes work for you.  Of course the `Set` did not exist in Javascript a few years ago and you had to do it another way usually using a filter.
✅ As a point of style and usefulness when creating higher-order functions.  I would not just print the value out but also return it from the function.\Otherwise very nicely laid out.
+1 to @ctarda's comment ☝️ . Then the `isAuthorizedToUploadMedia` check could be at the top of the new \"uploadPostWithMedia\" func...perhaps as `guard` statement e.g.:\\```\let isAuthorizedToUploadFiles = networkService.isAuthorizedToUploadMedia(in: sit

❓ I'm just guessing here based on the section comment...should these three versions be set to `16.5` instead of `${bundle.version}`?
❓ Same question about version for the export packages.
❗️ The above `getConfiguration()` will never return `null` by design since it either returns the object that already exist or creates a new one.
❓ Should we protect against `null` if the property doesn't exist yet?
❓ Is our goal to create the config if it doesn't exit? If not then we should do call `listConfiguration(\"(service.pid=\" + PID + \")\")`
❓ Why not use `rootResourceDirsEqual` here as well?
✏️ Should avoid calling `getProperties()` twice. Depending on the implementation it might not actually be a simple getter. It happens to be the case here.

✏️ Extract this complex/compound predicate to a method/field to simplify the stream.
✏️ This message isn't clear. It sounds like it's putting the condition above into English more than describing the incorrect state it found.
✏️ I'm really not a fan of variable static data being set as a function of an instance call. Especially with the null test in `verifyEncryptedElement` this feels like it could be set and then leak from test to test.

❓ Is there a reason you don't have any positive path tests?
✏️ Nit: In following the flow of the `SingleSignOnProfileVerifier` these two new tests should be added above the assertion tests.

⚠️ All of the `setAsync` functions (here  and on `flow` and `global`) must return the result of the setAsync call so the Function can use the Promise it returns.

✏️ CollectionUtils
✏️ Shouldn't combine concatenation with builder appends.
✏️ Moderately cheaper and simpler to read if you remove this test here add an `if (attributes == null)` test on line 118 and then just `return` then. You'll save the check on `subject` and potential local store.
❓Even though the `PostProcessingPlugin` interface isn't clear as to when the `PluginExecutionException` should be thrown it may still be safer than throwing a raw `RuntimeException`. We should also provide a message to the constructor.
✏️ I think it's worth making the `NAME_QUALIFIER` field protected so that you can access it for this assertion. Instead of using a String literal.
✏️ After addressing https://github.com/codice/ddf/pull/3354/files#r197213555 I'd recommend adding another test case to cover when the NameID format is not persistent.

❓Did we add some tests to cover the `calculateOverviewHeight()` and `calculateOverviewWidth()` methods? I'm still worried about the logic in there.
❗️ Side Note: If we get to this plugin and the NameQualifier is already set it should not be overridden. In other words only set the issuer's NameQualifier if it is empty/null.
❓ If you are only adding a bundle to a feature file does the module containing the feature file need the bundle as a dependency? I don't know the answer but this could have been the reason I was having errors in my feature loading for another ticket.

❗️ We should probably have another test for `setMatchCase(false)` and verify the following: \```\(v) -> verify(v).visitPropertyIsILikeType(eq(node)));\```
❓ Can this be collapsed down? \```\.map(json -> new FilterNodeMapImpl(json))\```\\Actually shouldn't the old syntax still work? \```\.map(FilterNodeMapImpl::new)\```
✏️ We should probably add a comment about this exceptional case since it's breaking an established pattern: `FilterVisitor2::visit ... Type`
✏️ We can probably use this method in place of all the other `TERMINAL_OPS.get(...)` calls. 
❓ I think the `CONTAINS` operation takes precedence on the UI compared with `MATCHCASE`. Should we swap the default to `Boolean.FALSE` instead? 
✏️ I think this will be sufficient. But I wonder if we should also verify `element.getDeclaredType()` which returns a `Class<T>` we could compare against `PropertyIsLikeType`. I don't think there's any added benefit. 
According to [this page](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/introducing-batch-gemm-operations) Intel MKL 11.3 Beta (part of Intel® Parallel Studio XE 2016 Beta) includes a new flavor of GEMM feature called \"Batch GEMM\".

❓ Wouldn't the `rhitem` normally be a weapon? We have a method on `game_state` that can 'get rid' of the weapon safely (and one that gets it back).
❓ If you check the summoning code there's some logic to check if your current weapon is summoned. I suggest checking for that outputting a message and returning. What do you think?
❓ Could any or all of these three be converted to the more reliable `bput`?
❓ Would you want to check if `@pet_box_source` is defined?
❓ Similar to the above question do you want to add a new test that if `Locks` is in `training_abilities` `pet_box_source` is also defined?
❓ What would you think about having `town` be a second parameter to `restock_items`? Then line 14 would pass in `@settings.hometown` and line 20 would pass in `hometown`
❓ Why is there string interpolation here instead of mapping to `k['hometown']` directly?
❓ Is this (and line 852) a 'common enough' value to use as a default?

❌ It feels very wrong to activate weak cipher suites for everyone when downloading artifacts. The whole point of TLS 1.2 is to make things more secure. Using a weak cypher over TLS 1.2 makes no sense IMO. JCenter needs to be fixed not our code.

Don't need to specify it but explicit is better than implicit ????‍♂️ \\`default=False` won't lock the table here as we're setting it to nullable. This just means in the future it will default to False but it won't touch existing rows.

✏️ Should rename map or add a comment so the source of these mapped values isn't a mystery
✏️ Should be CXF version 3.2.4 to match the version DDF is being upgraded to.

❗️  Instead of rerendering it might be better to call a method that toggles the class that hides and shows the dropdown based on the type.
✏️ Typically we avoid toggling classes on elements within the HTML and stick to toggling them on the main root el (`this.$el`).  In this case you could toggle a class called `is-custom` depending on the model's type.

❓ Does it make a difference that \"sha1\" isn't capitalized here?
❓ In @coyotesqrl's DDF PR he just calls `certificate.getSigAlgName();` instead of this line. Did you test with that? Did that include the `sha` piece of the name?
❓ Could we not just pass in BouncyCastle every time?
❓ Where did `SHA384` come from?

❓ Did you leave a .03 buffer on each of these numbers? Sometimes the numbers that jacoco calculates are slightly different on different OS's.
❗️ I'd rather not be looking at the nameIdPolicy at all. We should be just looking at the format of the NameID or Issuer element.
❗️ NOTE: I added null checks in for the assertion's subject and that subject's nameID since those are optional elements.
❓ Do we need to update the `FilterNodeValueSerializer` to check the `property` and `value` fields for `instanceof Map` or otherwise complex data structures and defer processing if that's the case? 
❓ For now we won't be able to support functions on `property` `value` or **both**?

❓ Is there a reason why you're destructuring state twice in this way?

❌ You've got a dangling comment over here.

❓If we don't couple resources with attribute overrides (see my comment above) would we still need this method?

✏️_resource_ instead of _file_? Same comment for the methods below.
❓Do we really want this exception to be checked or should we extend `RuntimeException` instead?
❓Should this interface have a `getId()` method that returns a value that matches up with the ID of the `Harvester` it consumes from?
❓Does this have to be human-readable? Should we also mention that this ID will be used to look up matching listeners?\✏️Should we add a note that the ID cannot be empty?
❓Since this API depends on `catalog-core-api` classes shouldn't the `catalog-harvest-api` feature have a dependency on the `catalog-core-api` feature or even better the `catalog-core-api-only` feature: https://github.com/codice/ddf/blob/master/catalog/
❓Should we also have that comment in the `Harvester` interface as well as an implementation option?
❗️What is the `Harvester` expected to do if one of those methods fails? Should it call them again a certain number of times before giving up? Should the listener be responsible for retrying? Should we even retry?
❓Should we add _Must be unique within the scope of the harvester producing the resource_ or something similar?
❓Curious to know why we expose the overrides on the resources. Adding this here creates an unnecessary coupling between resources and catalog metacards so we may want to avoid it.
❓Wondering if `Listener` isn't too generic. Think we should rename to `HarvestedResourceConsumer` or something similar?
❓Is the `Harvester` waiting for this call to return before moving on to the next event (see comment above)?
❗️Make sure to add this comment to the class' description when removing this method.

it should not happen normally but this is when scanning and libcore fails to calculate the addresses ????‍♂️

❓ is it possible for featureMember to be null?  Also wouldn't it make more sense to have this try block outside of the for loop?
❓ Are there any future operations that are executed on the web client that need permissions? 
✏️ This is an interesting change as I think some users are still going to get into a weird state if they don't read this.\I'd think we'd want to validate and warn users from the Admin UI but that might be beyond the scope of this change. 
✏️ This column could be updated to consistently always end with periods or not end with periods.
✅ Will change.
❓ What does that mean for those that use to run itests inside IntelliJ for debugging? \Should we had a readme file as to what they have to do? Or better have a profile or a -D option in the maven pom file to just start Solr?
❗️  Should be able to use `org.opensaml.saml.saml2.core.NameIDType.PERSISTENT` here.
✏️ Remove commented-out line.
❓ Shouldn't this run a second time for the second half of the condition? \❓ Should this also affirm that `1 * nameID.setNameQualifier(NAME_QUALIFIER)`?

✏️ This method is difficult to understand without going to the impl. How is the returned String formatted? I'd recommend either 1) Adding javadoc or 2) Renaming this method to something like `getConfigAsJsonString`. Or maybe both.
❗️ There's already a grant block for this module that you should just add the write permission to. https://github.com/blen-desta/ddf/blob/5b384c1f7e9a39f00e4b38bb7c5b543f54585e46/distribution/ddf-common/src/main/resources/security/default.policy#L185
✏️ We could tack this module onto another similar grant block. The only additional permission it would get is read access to users.attributes which I don't think is an issue.  @stustison what do you think?\\https://github.com/blen-desta/ddf/blob/5b384c
this is so terrible..... ruby ????‍♀️ 
❓ Logging needs permission to _write_ the file?
_waits for `Array.includes` in TS..._\\Local style should be:\\```typescript\} else if (columnMetadata.type === \"json\" ||\           columnMetadata.type === \"jsonb\" ||\           this.spatialTypes.indexOf(columnMetadata.type) >= 0) {\```\\❓

Two very minor nitpicks:\\1. The spec is missing a `Nothing`\\```elixir\@spec new(any() [nothing: any()]) :: Just.t() | Nothing.t()\```\\(Also may as well add the expected key while we're in there ☝️)\\2. Have you considered using pattern match
Oh my ????‍♂️  yes indeed!
I'm going with a `NodeWrapper` instead to avoid that ☝️ We can talk about naming after I get the commit up if you guys don't like it ???? 
✏️ I was going to say we need to test this in IE10 but it looks like master currently is having issues with IE10 in general.  For now would you mind updating this to be the following:\```\ > .ingest-uploader {\    .customElement;\    white-space: now
❗️ There's no reason to shadow these here as you can access these views through `this.ingestDetails.currentView` and `this.ingestEditor.currentView`.
✏️ This method can be removed.
✏️ This class is currently unused.
❓ Why the update?
❓ Why not pass in undefined or null if `properties.editorAttributes.length === 0`?\\If we did that then we could also check for `properties.editorAttributes.length` before showing the editor and avoid the costs associated.
❗️ This refers to an animation that doesn't exist it should be removed.
❗️ Should be `@minimumSpacing`
❗️ Remove this class from the div and use `is-header` so it's consistent with other areas.
✏️ This part can be simplified a bit.  \```\.ingest-editor-footer {\    > button {\      padding: 0px @minimumSpacing;\      white-space: nowrap;\      overflow: hidden;\      text-overflow: ellipsis;\      width: 100%;\    }\  }\```\This also
✏️ For new files we're trying to stick to a newer syntax since it helps avoid mismatches between the array and the parameters in the function.  \\```\const Marionette = require('marionette');\etc.\\module.exports = Marionette.LayoutView....\```
❗️ This can be simplified to:\```\.for-error {\    color: contrast(@negative-color);\    display: none;\    line-height: @minimumLineSize;\    padding-left: @minimumSpacing;\    background: @negative-color;\    height: auto;\  }\\  &.failed-req
✏️ This method can be removed.
❗️  Should be `max-height` so the as near to the content as possible.
✏️ This can be removed.
Can we update all the changed files with ©️s to 2018? 
Yea I agree with the naming as text. But I think for now no need to change the PROJECT_CATEGORIES files on `config`. Maybe we can do that later when we use an actual database?\\Thanks about the mindset though ✌️ 
Was thinking of `lowest_priority` but `lowest_priority` could also mean lowest value which has the high privileges ????‍♂️ Couldn't think of a better name at the moment.
????  The convention is to use _when_....._it should_\❌  I prefer not to use literal terms of code elements in the title of a test case. See also point 12 of https://www.continuousimprover.com/2015/11/12-tips-to-write-unit-tests-that-dont.html
I **don't** like this code at all... I know I should make a constructive criticism and give you an alternative but I don't have it so... Just I wanted to let you know that I'm not happy with it ????‍♂️ 
unusual seeing `undefined` to be passed to skip the default  value ????‍♂️ 
This has been there for a while we need to tell people about it! ✨
Hm ts was fine with `Scheduler` ???? ????‍♂️
I will place it in a const named ITEM_AVAILABLE or something ????‍♂️ 
❔ What's with the brackets around the key? This some ES6 feature I've forgotten about?
❓ This should happen in the constructor I believe?
❓ This seems like a brittle check - is there no better way?
⚠️ ❓ I don't think this method if required anymore on the `CallbackThrottle`. The `CallbackThrottle` will always be able to callback to the `Downloader` for a given `Batch`. If the batch is removed then it is removed from the map when it is removed from 
❓ If this page size is greater than the internal framework limit it means the subscription size could never be greater than that. Did we want to use the ResultIterator here?
oh that is interesting. who knew ????‍♀️ 
✏️ it would be mighty fine to clean this up into a string format or the like if you're feeling up to it
❓ Why the curly braces in this method?
✏️ if `wkt` can be `null` then it should be annotated with `@Nullable`. If not then we can replace the `StringUtils.isBlank(wkt)` below with `wkt.isEmpty()`
Same as below ⬇️
✏️ Can you indent this so it's in line with the rest? Also looks like there are new lines above and below it.
First question was just out of curiosity ????\\Yes you're right. I forgot that _that find_ was `Array.find` instead of `_.find` ????‍♂️

Shorthand ✋
A little leftover white space to trim here if you don't mind ✂️ 
❤️ Thanks @choldgraf!
❓ Do all other bundles need that write permission though?
❓ Are those required because they are on the stack? If so could the `admin-core-insecuredefaults` simply extends its privileges when it is performing the deletion?
With the statusIndicator this will result in the output which shows the generating manifest 2 times: \```\❯ ./bin/codius.js upload --host http://local.codius.org:3000 -o --debug\⚠ Hosts will NOT be added to the HOSTS env in the generated manifest.\✔ V

✏️ The double negative in the variable name is kind of confusing. What do you think about `NOT_OPERATOR_UNSUPPORTED_MSG`?
❓Do the failure messages in the assertions against `pointRadiusSearches` need to be updated? They still reference using an AND filter. (there may be others messages that also need to be updated)
✏️ I think the naming of this bundle is a bit confusing because it's not an endpoint. Something like `session-manager-api` and `session-manager-impl` for the two new bundles might be more intuitive. Just a thought
❗️ The `session-management-endpoint` bundle will need the same permissions as the `security-servlet-session-expiry` bundle. `catalog-ui-search` might need permissions as well if it doesn't already have them
❗️ Still missing `1 * nameID.setNameQualifier(NAME_QUALIFIER)` from @coyotesqrl's comment.
✏️ \"test name qualifier when issuer is null and nameid format is persistent\" (\"issuer\" instead of \"issuer format\") (\"nameid format is persistent\" instead of \"is persistent\")
❓ Shouldn't this be `2 *`? I would think `getFormat()` would be called twice here: https://github.com/bantillo/ddf/blob/05f34805478cf1061664f142b29a2a25645fec35/platform/security/idp/security-idp-plugin/security-idp-plugin-namequalifier/src/main/java/org/
✏️ This test and the one above it have two empty lines at the end. They should only have a max of one.
✏️ Remove commented out line
????‍♂️ thanks
❗️ Since we're doing a composed menu here now we need to remove some unnecessary less in this file.  It looks like this:\```\     &:hover\     &.is-active {\       background: fade(contrast(@backgroundDropdown) 10%);\}\```
❗️ Height of 100% doesn't make sense here.  Should look like this:\```\padding: 0px;\height: auto;\```
❗️ We need to add the `composed-menu` class here so the menu navigation behavior functions correctly.
@melvinsoft My bad I didn't notice that GitHub truncated the file so I didn't see the other function at all. ????‍♂️ \\Merge ???? 
Can do was just following the React implementation which has `onChange` as a required argument but still makes this check ????‍♂️ 
While you're at it add a newline between 23 and 24. ✨ 
That is the only question that needs an action ☝️ 
This `id` wasn't even specified anywhere so ????‍♂️ 
Don't think so.\\The above results in `em.text-highlight {` as a selector.  I think yours would be `.text-highlight.em` (Haven't tested but looks like that would be what it would output❓)
❓ Is this constructor ever passed `null` values?
Oh darn. Apparently what we need is a ✨ *[supercow](https://docs.rs/supercow/0.1.0/supercow/)* ✨ but it would be kind of dumb to add that library just for this instance.\\That closure solution looks fine to me although I'm also fine with merging as is

❓ Since this says pet boxes is the assumption that boxes you pick up off the ground _won't_ be used for picking?
✏️ Can we use the `SystemBaseUrl` getters instead of the property literals? It prevents typos and if we ever need to refactor any of these again it is *much* easier to catch.
✏️ This isn't quite as self-explanatory and might be worth a [documentation](https://github.com/codice/ddf/blob/50ff030c1c660b73c8bbd223c9cd9b2f02efad4b/distribution/docs/src/main/resources/content/_tables/ResponseHeaderConfig.adoc) update.

✏️ Probably worth mentioning that this will return `null` if the `jsonp` parameter is invalid.

Strange that this works because if you have a constraint on `leading` with a spacing of `16` and a centerX it will automatically make the `trailing` have a spacing of `16` from the end. \\☝️ Read my post about this for more info ([link](https://medium.
i think it becomes pretty clear further down but it couldn't hurt ????‍♀️ 
❓ Should this really be an internal error or a bad request?
✏️ It would probably be good in this and all of these related PRs if the concrete REST classes that have been updated to implement interfaces had the `@Override` annotation added to the overridden methods.
✨ Great catch! I originally made `filter` nil here in https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/5346b0274705cab689a432d29e9f44c0999e609a but made it non-nil in 3b86f30 which allows us to remove this conditional.
❗️ We should JavaDoc this interface more and add an experimental header.
❓ We have the `GeoCoder` interface which looks very similar. Was there any reason that wasn't used?
✏️ This doesn't need to be inside the `try/catch` block. Consider moving the `persistentStore.get()` call and error handling to a separate function so this one can be simplified.

✏️ Since I am bad myself at naming things I won't suggest something but `getPush`  `getPull` and `getPublish` seems weird to me. Boolean accessors are usually named something like `isXXXX` or `hasXXXX` and based on the previous comment this might chan

IMHO that would be part of the ui-kit issue there is no emotion in dcos-ui yet ????‍♂️ If I finalize the component here then there is no need for this staging folder thing… the Idea was to move on fast and optimize later instead of blocking this whole PR
Great detective work ????️‍♀️ 
❤️ Love the red!
They’re also useful in creating a scope for `const` variable definitions inside the case statement. We used them a lot on Mozilla projects especially in switch case statements for reducers. ????????‍♂️
❕ This form makes the check in the analyzer more expensive than necessary especially considering the deserialized `StyleCopSettings` object is cached. The conversion to `ImmutableArray<string>` should occur in the constructor.

@frederike-ramin you actually fixed a different indentation problem in https://github.com/schul-cloud/gamification/pull/50/commits/e69a1b13c2a9133f9118f8975fc3cc9c4cb5a3cb this problem here still remains ⛵️

❓ Is it worth collecting these three bundles into a feature?
❓ I'm unclear about the use of this regex. Is this the standard/approved way of extracting multipart data with Spark? It seems rather brittle. 
☝️ seconded I think `npm version <patch|minor|major>` relieves the headache of manually changing the package and creating a git tag.
Spacing... ☹️ 
❓ Why are we defining these here?
❓ Should we define these versions in the parent pom?
❓ Are those suppressions still required with the changes?
❓ Looks like these used to be managed dependencies. They're embedded but do we want to get back to that at some point?
✏️ I would really prefer to see this lambda extracted to a method to keep the stream processing logic and the lower-level \"do this to each metacard\" logic separated.\\Could also consider extracting some of the filtering logic - the check for empty tags 
❓ Is there a reason you didn't just add the `<feature>platform-migratable-api</feature>` dependency which starts both of the above bundles?
Also where are your tests for `User`? ❓ 
✅  And this basically resolves the entire method as a whole ???? 
✏️ I don't think this catch statement is needed since `UnsupportedEncodingException` is already caught by the catalog service implementation.
❓ What line(s) of code do we need to catch `IOException` for? Seems like you're already handling `IOException` internally.
❓ Should we also have a `testParsePartsWithAttributeOverrides` test to pair with `testParseAttachmentsWithAttributeOverrides`?
❗️ I'd like to get @lessarderic's thoughts on this change. I'm concerned that the boundary for this test is changing significantly. Specifically we're no longer testing any of the business logic that got moved from `RestEndpoint` to `CatalogServiceImpl`.
✏️ `Constructing CatalogServiceImpl`
✏️ Maybe rename to `CatalogServiceException` to be less generic?
✏️ You shouldn't need to include the version here. It should just inherit from the parent.
✏️ This isn't necessary.
✏️ `CatalogServiceImpl constructed successfully`
✏️ You could return it on line 324 instead of using a variable.
❗️ We should double-check downstream projects to make sure they aren't using any of these classes directly. They'll need to be updated if they are.\\To be clear by \"these classes\" I mean any of the classes in here for which you're changing the package 
❓ Also is there a reason you're only testing the `getHeaders` and `getDocument` methods?
❓ Do we want to log like we are in `RestEndpoint`?\> LOGGER.trace(\"Ping!\");

❗️ I would think we'd want to also verify that the nameId's format value is equal to `format`
✏️ You don't need the `isError` column and variable.
❗️ We technically don't support this in our metadata and I don't think STS will ever give us a NameID in this format.
❗️ Don't we want to fail if the format value already exists and it's not equal to the policy's format? For example I think it's incorrect for us to have an email formatted nameID but to then overwrite the format value to persistent.

Not sure if this should be removed or remain ????‍♂️ 
❓ Do these times need to be more dynamic? What happens if the range doesn't exist?
❓ Should we reference poi.version so that we can always use the latest version? I think this version range will work but might be better for maintenance. I'm thinking about the potential suppressions of older versions of POI.

@rzwiefel since it was a question and not a ❗️or request for change went ahead. I think it is still something we can change if we need to do so.

If tests pass ????‍♂️ . I'd only double check this isn't for some search output fields stuff where we'd need the result from the response there.
❗️ This is not threadsafe. Checking the value of an atomic variable only guarantees it was that value when called calling `get` a second time could produce a different value.

❓ Do these `cref` attributes get validated during the build (e.g. does a mis-typed name produce a warning or error? It seems like the compiler would validate them but I'm not sure how the overall experience is.

❓ Is the added `>` intentional? If so I would prefer it be escaped (`&gt;`) to avoid this question in the future.

❓ Does this only affect the Bitbucket plugin? How do other forms handle the same situation? Can we not update the translation app to provide this value?
➡️ I moved this back to the original location but I'm leaving further refactorings as a separate follow-up issue to coordinate in an audit of our existing command handlers for similar situations. I would be surprised if Encapsulate Field was the only one

❓ Is there value to a validator that checks that the value of `combat_teaching_skill` is a valid skill? Or warns when it's say Stealth Thievery Sorcery Arcane ...?
❓ Is the goal for the teacher to learn Scholarship or the teachee to learn the skill? I.e. should this be controlled by a timer or something other than skill experience like 'Favor Orb'?
❓ Is my understanding correct that the 'exp timer' value for 'Teach' is 'how often to check the room for students'?
Thanks for the response. I'm going to take a look at this today and try to find another way. If I can't then I'll ✔️ this.
This is not a bug. A zero value indicates that the variable hasn't been set. A value close to zero indicates a valid location that is just west of Africa ????‍♀️

❌ Containing `buildSrc` is fine. The question is why we generate something else than our internal mirror in there? Maybe because there is no `build.gradle` in `buildSrc`? So I guess we should add that. Note that we already use the mirrors in the templates
❌ The javascript repository should be mirrored by our repository too.

❓ Why do we need 4 threads for the failsafe executor? Will a single thread work for this?

I _think_ they both work ????‍♂️

Perfect answer ✅
✏️ We could technically remove the pax-web-api dependency in the pom as well. It was added for this ErrorPage stuff specifically: https://github.com/codice/ddf/commit/bb596ddbd3713ed9e8a87a46f8a32eddb4e2d2a3#diff-b6f9cda1762d1bbe6a83aa719ad6eb79
✏️ Should be `ErrorPageInjectorSpec`
✏️ You could look into Guava's way of initializing a map. You could just do something like `ImmutableMap.of()` and pass in all the String literals you need. And it wouldn't need to be in the constructor at that point. It could just be initialized on line 
❓ Are all these things going to fail once we change versions? Not everyone has the same Java version either.
✏️ I believe we could also compile a pattern for the contains check.
✏️ We should compile the patterns ahead of time for performance.
Should we document that? `// Call memoized conj_del_fn function so that it gets saved in memory` or something? I don't know maybe it's self-explanatory ????‍♀️ 
can't remember why though ????‍♂️ 
❓ Do we need `id_txt_tokenized` ? Since we moved away from hyphenated uuid's this tokenization isn't applicable to our ID's even. 
❓ Why do we need prerequisite=\"true\" here? If it is needed can we put a comment stating why it is needed? 
❓ What does it mean to add this mapping if the holder has not been started or initialized? Should we add a similar message in the warning above that Jetty's default error page will be used?
Given that it's an _options_ object shouldn't it be you know optional? (I believe I'd originally added the default value in f1a731e8d94a53dda7490d62adfcc9383a4ad731 to account for tests. ????‍♂️ )
I actually ended up doing the `getCache` refactor when I used this in anger to add Redis - I just made some mistakes with my Java generics when I attempted it before so left it like ☝️this. Will refactor.
❗️ The version has to be `2.13.1-SNAPSHOT`
❗️ I don't think we'd want to close it anyways even if it was. This should end up being the stream result sent to the other client iirc. If you close it then they'll get a truncated result when the server closes it on its end.
❓ should `GeoCodingConstants.COUNTRY_GAZETTEER_SORT_VALUE` also be added as a secondary sort value to this list?
➡️ Should be fixed now ???? 
☝️ Yep `userID` is up in the air and likely will be injected into the view controller. 
➡️ I'll leave this as a follow-up item. I agree it seems useful.
This is on the svg itself not on the button and ... this is the display value that is needed for the height to remain the same in the before/after ????‍♀️ Otherwise there is some weird padding below the arrows.

Oh i just realized none of the tests are browser tests -- they're just in node so the browsers don't actually matter. ????‍♀️

✏️ This is redundant with logic in the `retrieveHttpProduct ` method. That logic should be removed. https://github.com/codice/ddf/blob/aa2174df245707f5f0ea2186c4897359b16c0db7/catalog/core/catalog-core-urlresourcereader/src/main/java/ddf/catalog/resource/
❓ Does the policy file need to be updated according to this change?
Err nope we were using the **wrong** package name -> s/target/targets/ ????‍♂️ 
this method can be removed ♻️ 
❗️ The problem here is that you have no way to know if the code that starts unit testing and ends up calling your test method doesn't already have the AccessController in the stack. The best approach would be to verify up the stack until you hit your test
❗️ This relies on the `toString()` returning a given format. You would be better of testing the classname separately. As for testing the test method I think it is sufficient to check if the AccessController is on the stack.
❓ I feel like this may be a bit silly but there's obviously a lot of repetition in most of these methods especially the ones that don't include any kind of specific error details. Would it be worth implementing a single `__call()` method to handle all o
Ah thanks! I'll file that away. ✅ 
I see that the only change between both standards in the title. Maybe we could use the type in the record in this text or add the condition just over here. ☝️ \\wdyt?
❓ Just curious what motivations for the move to EndpointUtil
yeahhhh i know but that seems more relevant after the API is like shipped to the world and is in use. i figure when we're still all internal we can change the proto at will for the sake of cleanliness...? i don't feel strongly tho ????‍♀️ 
I'm down. Show me the `Rx` ways. ✨ 
this is pretty dude ❤️ 
✂️ remove auto-generated files or fulfil them with meaningful specs.
✂️ and use indentation.
Would it make sense if this condition was in the `format_according_to_decimals` itself? If so we have a possibility of ✂️ these functions and keep these decisions centralized in the currency helper.
❓ `platform-error-servlet` is a bundle should we be embedding this?
Oh really? I figured because it was one less command it'd be faster ????‍♂️\\Still an `IN_VEHICLE(unit)` (alternatively `ON_FOOT`) macro would improve code readability imo (it's more clear what's being checked).
this link was also broken so i fixed it ????‍♂️

Re: Image feedback\\Perhaps they can be merged as is now and modified later ????‍♂️ 
There's nothing really that we could transform it into ????‍♀️  so I error out here instead of just doing nothing
i think instead of fetching the packages once it would be better to subscribe to changes ???? (no idea if `CosmosPackageStore` is built that way tho… ????‍♂️ )

Using it in an upcoming change you mean? Currently it's not in the method signature (it's just using `this.combined` in the function)\\That said to make it run when `combined` changes makes total sense! Did not make that connection ????‍♂️
Yeah me either. When I say using it now. I meant in a commit that will be pushed soon ????‍♀️ 
Yeah right after I pushed it I checked and thought I'd have to amend the commit but apparently that's the preferred American English spelling. ????‍♂️ 
❓ What is `100` in this context? 
❓ Should we perform a check here to make sure that `this.geometry != undefined` because otherwise your anonymous function `capitalize` will break if you call `capitalize(undefined)`? 
❓ Is this `break` needed? Won't it use the `break` at the end of this case? 
Hey @bordoni would you mind to take a look over here ⬆️.\\Thanks
✏️ Here is an idea ... capture the starting stack when doCapture() is called such that you can remove the first matching frames from your search in your matcher later.
✏️ Always easier to read if you move that logic in a private method that receives a StackTraceElement and use a method reference here.
ohhh ooops wrong template ????‍♂️ 
\"Error closing\" with `debug`? ????‍♂️ 
✏️ I guess technically this should be private?
❓ This seems strange...the method has an `Object` return type and here we're returning and empty string. Why?
❓ Isn't this already what's in `fileExt` at line 181? Why not just return that?
❓ Is it possible that there is no `ACCEPT_ENCODING` header in the request which would lead to an NPE here?

✏️ You're probably getting a warning on this in intellij. Could add `@SuppressWarnings(\"WeakerAccess\" /* Called from blueprint */)` which would suppress it and also document that the method is needed.

The actual column is added here: https://github.com/dcos/dcos-ui/pull/3167\I'll change the implementation to use natural sort - have to rebase the feature branch anyway ????‍♂️ 
This is what happens when I copy-paste too much code ????‍♂️

✏️ Why were TestRequestUtils and the code to mock the client moved out of this common class? It looks like all of the DiscoverSourcSpecsdo the same thing?
✏️ `DiscoverOpenSearchSourceSpec`
Usually this happens automatically because the saga which is using the error handler will clear it the next time you run the saga. I see why it's necessary here. Hey it works ????‍♀️ 
❓ Is there a reason we're not using a version property in the root pom or even dependency management on this?
❓ I don't care much either way but why are these properties instead of final fields initialized in the ctor?
❓ If options is an object passed in do we need to create a new object from it?
❓ Why do we use 89.9 instead of 90?
❓ If options is an object passed in do we need to create a new object from it?
✏️  Could be an arrow function / lambda
✏️ Could be an arrow function / lambda
✏️ Could define these as the arguments instead of having props. Ex: `({label cursor geometryKey unitKey widthKey}) => { ...}`
❓ Do we care that the `categories` field can be mutated by the caller?
✏️ I see that we're using jsoup version 1.9.2 in a few other places in DDF. Should we create a version property and upgrade elsewhere so we're on a single up-to-date version?
❓ Do you need a new list at the end of this process or can you modify the input list to sort it? If the latter could just call `categories.sort(Comparator.comparing(HtmlExportCategory::getTitle))`
✏️ I don't see much value in separating out the class that does the majority of the work into a utility class. It doesn't appear to be used by any other consumer but this transformer so there's no value in refactoring it; putting its functionality in here

✅ worth adding a test to cover this nested config stuff seeing as it's what we came here to build.

Thanks for adding this README. It will be super helpful to the team moving forward ❤️.\\<img src=https://media.giphy.com/media/mbhseRYedlG5W/giphy.gif />

Can we use `*.css` or `*.js` here ❓ 
I think it will be appropriate to rename the option value result `$caseTypeWorkflowCategory` to reflect option values ????‍♂️ .

✏️ It may be a good idea to log this at a lesser level. I think I remember being told that not being able to close a stream isn't that big of a deal.\\Can anyone confirm this?
Perfect answer ✅
Yea pretty much spot on ✅
needs ❤️. But not _too_ much for the first iteration. Let's just get the spike out and address issues as they pop up.
Ah right thanks for the reminder ⚡️ 
☝️ Agreeing with Jonathan on this -- our usual pattern is to have another `incoming-service` called something like `twilio-studio-works.execution.schedule`. The `execution.schedule` handler would do most of the work in `schedule-studio-for-row` function (
oops didn't catch the airbnb repo ????‍♂️ 
✏️ Should not rely on these two messages being back-to-back in the log file for context. In a very busy system other threads could easily interject log messages between them. Use a more descriptive message for the debug log.
✏️ If the guts of this loop were extracted to a private method then switching this logic to be `optionalHttpContext.ifPresent() { -> }` would be clearer.
✏️ The block from here through line 104 would be better extracted to a private method. 
✏️ Alternately could do something like\```java\    Map<String String> foo =\        Stream.of(\"400\" \"401\" \"403\" \"404\" \"405\" \"406\" \"500\" \"501\" \"502\" \"503\" \"504\")\            .collect(Collectors.toMap(Function.identity() x -> errorPagePath)
❓ Is a return really what you want right here? This would short-circuit the loop if any single service were missing the http context yes?
✏️ Extracting the guts of this loop to a method will clean up the code nicely and keep things at a single context level.
❓ This isn't really possible is it? Should it be an error instead?
Yup spot on with this! I see you know that responsive with be more smooth as the width changes.\Adaptive with be more snappy.\✅
❗️ See above comment about security.
✏️ Could rename this method to clarify what bundle context you are grabbing maybe something like `getErrorPageInjectorContext`.
❓ ✏️ Also could blueprint make getting the `ErrorPageInjector` class easier?
❗️ Since printing stacktraces to the browser is a security issue it might not be a good idea to log that in case potential threats view the logs.\\And dw this is coming from a guy who put another vulnerability we had in the title of a ticket ????.
Yup using min-width media queries ✅
Yup using max-width media queries ✅
Perfect ✅
Spot on ✅
basically i just copied their component https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/blob/master/src/rsg-components/SectionHeading/SectionHeadingRenderer.js and added some inline styles... ????‍♂️ 
❗️ Although unlikely this could throw a `ClassCastException`. We should probably handle it and log something when that happens.
❗️ This is duplication of the `error` feature in the utilities `features.xml`: https://github.com/codice/ddf/blob/090b73a83971162a82cfff3686a1c0b06f71725f/features/utilities/src/main/feature/feature.xml#L58 I'd recommend remove this one from this features
❓ Couldn't the `getErrorHandler` method return `null`? That would mean that `errorPageErrorHandler.getErrorPages();` would throw an NPE. Could just do `if (errorPageErrorHandler != null && errorPageErrorHandler.getErrorPages().isEmpty()`
????‍♂️ Maybe a readability thing. I'll keep it.
✏️ \"These are the best options\" sounds odd to me especially with only one option. Maybe something like \"... go here:\"?
✏️ This wording sounds weird to me. Maybe \"Occurs how often\" and \"What percentage of the time does it occur\"?
i felt like it made the control flow _slightly_ easier to follow but ????‍♀️ 
????‍♂️  at Etherscan's params naming convention.
❓ Will this cause an issue anywhere we use `mockito-all-1.10.19.jar` in our tests? Seems the `VerificationMode` for that artifact does not have this method and I want to ensure that'll be a compile time failure not runtime. 
❓ Should we add some candidate circumstances when testing for this should occur? And when it shouldn't? If we abuse this we might end up in trouble since we rely on reflection. Should every privileged call have tests for this stuff? Or only critical secur
❓Did we lower the amount of memory allocated to the DDF Java process to account for the increased amount of memory allocated to Solr?
❓Should we recommend that the delay by shorter than the one used for DDF?

✋ We pass a no-op action as the default to _onPipelineCompleted rather than throwing an exception and I think we should do the same here.
✋ XML doc comments aren't really appropriate here IMO. a) it's a private method and b) it's in a test fixture. I think the comment would be made redundant if the method were named something like `ThrowIfErrorDocument`.
✋ `Document.ToString()` returns `SourceId` and we allow implementers to override that on their own `Document` types as they wish. I don't think we should dump the `SourceId` properties in these messages rather just the source document.
✋  Reassigning `d` here is dangerous and at best unclear; is this deliberate? I think this should be collapsed into a statement lambda.
❓/:hand: Why a manual fake over a Substitute? Some tests use this others use a Substitute and make the same assertion.
❓ What's the purpose of this method? It looks like it can be replaced with a lambda.
✋ This can be made a private nested class of the `ProcessExtension` class as it represents an implementation detail of those methods. It may be possible also to replace it with a `ValueTuple`.
❓ I assume this TODO is one of the bits still in progress which you mentioned? This lives with the `OnDocumentError` method above.
✋ These two extension methods can be collapsed into a single generic method accepting a `TInput` type parameter; it could be made fully-generic by specifying a `TOutput` type parameter too (and replacing all instances of `WaivesDocument` with `TOutput`). 
✋ This method feels like it's in the wrong place. Perhaps we need a class (e.g. `CreateDocumentStep`) wrapping rate limiting and error handling where this could then live.
✋ Again I think this could move to a separate class maybe `PipelineStep`.
❓ I know @tbatie would ask this if he were reviewing it before me ???? : Is the `prerequisite=\"true\"` necessary? Or will the `catalog-security-filter` bundle be able to start up and wait until `catalog-core-api` is finished starting? It's a smell that bund
Yes @Juice10 a better test would really be good to have. Can you take a look at the dry-run option mentioned at the link above ☝️ 
I know this was all capitalised like this beforehand but would calling this `html` instead of `HTML` make more sense? First case being uppercase implies a component/constant by convention to me. ????‍♂️
✏️ This is extremely pedantic but \```java\invocations\  .stream()\  .filter()\```\would read a little cleaner to me. You'd want to extract the catch clause to a named function but one could argue that also improves readability.
❓ I don't know if it matters but would it make more sense for these statics to be overloaded constructors instead since all they do is return an instance of the enclosing class?
I think these tests are a bit silly but I guess it makes sense to prevent people to accidentally change their values without realizing that changing them will impact existing SDK users.\\????‍♂️

❓Should we null-protect these methods?
✏️ Consts.
✏️ I think it'd be better to extract this out to a private method that reads the args and puts that map into the `value` field.
❓ Is anything else ever expected to implement this interface?\❓ Is there any reason this impl should be internal to this class and not a top-level class itself?
✏️ Likewise extract the args-processing bit here to a private method.
✏️ I believe you could simplify this to something like...\```java\return REGISTRY\  .getTransforms()\  .stream()\  .filter(t -> shouldDoTransform.apply(t filter))\  .findFirst()\  .map(t -> howToDoTransform.apply(t filter))\  .orElse(filter);\`
❓ I'm asking this blind to the remainder of the review: does this have to be a single gigantic interface that covers all filter types? Could the sections you've demarcated be separate interfaces? Does every builder impl have to support all functions here

✏️ You could use the [`hasSize()`](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/javadoc/1.3/org/hamcrest/Matchers.html#hasSize(int)) matcher instead.
✏️ Consider extracting this lambda to a private function.\\Also since it's a singleton map why not map the attribute to a `Map.Entry` instead so you don't have to `flatMap` later?
❓What's the value of this test?\\Moreover I don't think we need to assert that the transformer is non-null in every test.
✏️ Consider loading this from a resource file instead.

✏️ `createBinaryContent`? `AndReturn` isn't very descriptive.
❓Since `value` and `fromString` are both `final` why not just pass in the value as a `T` and not have to do the conversion from `String` to `T` every time you want to get the value?

❕ Pass `cancellationToken`
✏️ The bundle-specific logic can also be extracted.
✏️ All of the permission getting/setting functionality could easily be extracted to another class and delegated to from here.\\In fact instead of delegating the users of `Debug` could call something like `Debug.permissionHandler().XXX()`

❓ Where is `quick_retry` defined?
❓ I'm wondering if we can move this `MutationGuard` instance inside `DefaultGradle` instance and just have all `Project` fetch the guard from there and below we could use `MutationGuards.of(project)` to get the guard. This assumes a single `Gradle` insta
❓  Now that we removed the mutation guard from this class would it make sense to move the mutation guard somewhere else that is instantiated once per build session?

To be clear this is definitely a hack. ☹️ I'm just not sure how to strip the unused import any other way. And if it's important to us to avoid importing the 816 byte interaction-tracking production bundle then we have to strip it.

❓ This hadn't occurred to me before now but for all these builder methods that take varargs/lists do you care how many times they are invoked by callers? Should you clear out the list on each invocation before adding the input contents?
❓ The case on the collection of related resources is camel-cased like above and on each contained `RelatedResource` is init-caps?
❓ Same here: don't these doubles need to come in pairs?
✏️ Alternately: `ddms.sources.forEach {}`
✏️ Can remove the first test.
❓ Any reason to deal with these three common fields this way instead of converting `ProducerBuilder` to an abstract class?
❓ Are the errors clear enough to the consumer of the api when they try to invoke the `build` method on one of the builders where the `lateinit` vars have not been set? Are they obtuse or can the user figure out what they've done wrong?
✏️ Alternately: `ddms.languages.forEach {}`
❓ Function should be an overload of the `producer` name yes?
✏️ Can remove the first test.
✏️ This second call to get the next tag is getting one of the coverage types? Can it be commented to make it clearer?
❓ Are there any restrictions on the labels? Blank/null values?
✏️ As a personal preference I don't like to pollute the global namespace too much. Would suggest moving `linearRing` (and similarly with all the other functions supporting the DSL) into companion object of class. Then consumers would just invoke `LinearR
✏️ S/b \"...contain an ism:classification\"

✏️ Can remove the first test.

✏️ Should bump to latest `1.2.61` as of this review.
❓ I see that in `PointBuilder` `id` is being initialized to an empty string instead of being lateinit. Is there a reason they're treated differently?
❓ Should this be `lateinit` instead? What is a \"default\"/empty `CountryCode`?
✏️ Alternately: `ddms.types.forEach {}`
❓ Don't these doubles need to be a pair to represent a point? If so should enforce that through the signature or at least with a `require` check.
❓ Do you not want/need to support an overload that takes a `List<GeographicIdentifier>`? The other builders all have the `List` overloads when they have `vararg`.
✏️ This is potentially very inefficient/expensive (depending on how common any of the date formats other that ISO_OFFSET are. Since the four formats this accepts are of distinct sizes it might be better to check the length of the input `date` and select 
✏️ It only matters in terms of a) consistency and b) return type but I tend to prefer `apply` over `run`. It doesn't make a big difference but SAML-CTK used `apply` over `run` if we want to shoot for Codice consistency.
✏️ The comment should be `yyyy-MM-dd`.
✏️ Should this instead confirm that there is at least one non-blank title?
❓ Is this a usual/canonical ordering for the four compass points in ddms? Because it reads weird to me. I expect to see NSEW-ordered lists when there is no external ordering requirement.\\❓ How do these four doubles define a box? Each point on a plane (
✏️ Should this instead confirm that there is at least one non-blank identifier?
❓ Do we not need to get the value of `No classification` back? Is that just reserved for missing values?
✏️ Similar question here where instead of only checking that at least one of the lists has an entry we confirm that at least one of the lists contains a non-blank entry?
❓ Would it be better to have a `toString` or `toOutput` method of some such on the enum itself that could print out its name in lowercase? Then you could just have a single `ddmsAttribute(\"direction\" relatedResources.direction.toOutput())` call here.
✏️ I think it would be easier to read if the fields that were directly copied over were in one group and those that were joined lists were then in a second group perhaps with a blank line between them.

❓ How do the multiple `names` relate to the singular `surname`?

❓ Not a `Date` either internally or as the parameter passed in? No need to overload to support that as input?
✏️ Other than the wrapping `ddmsElement` this method is identical to `writeService`. Could refactor to a single method that takes that element name and a `Producer`.
We'll want to add a `❗️` in the far right column for this one if it ends up being a security issue

❗️ Same comments as above.
❗️ Do we really want to return a reference to the internal byte array? Changes to that will impact the input stream and this resource implementation. How about a ByteBuffer in read-only mode instead?

❓Do we really need to export those packages? Usually only interfaces and exceptions are exported.
❓ Should we prevent `attributes` from being `null`? If it can be we should add `@Nullable`.

no need for variables if you're just going to assign it in the line anyways ????‍♂️ 
❗️ Yes @CyrusNajmabadi is correct. Stated more clearly: we want to keep the trailing trivia but we want to move it so it's placed *after* the initializer as opposed to *before* it. Otherwise this looks good!
By separating individual cases with empty line you will make the code more readable. ☺️

I agree with you. ✅
Yeah I think that'll be awesome! ❤️ 
This is a bug fix that is already a thing on the live Werewolf Bot but it seems the `master` branch hadn't received that update yet. ????‍♀️ 
That is… interesting. I can see your reasoning. I personally would rather trust the compiler (with lto) to figure out my hot paths and what to inline there though ????‍♂️
@jdinan ????‍♂️ yeah I know.  I will #define a \"MAX\" for this.  I wanted to use `LONG_MAX` but of course that has the same dependence on the `typedef` in the other file.  Or just leave it uninitialized.

✏️ Should probably mention that we compare both the metacard _and_ resource creation and modified dates.
❓ Since we need to use `getAttribute()` for `METACARD_MODIFIED` and `METACARD_CREATED` think we should just use that for `MODIFIED` and `CREATED` as well and just have the list contain attribute names instead of method references? That would make things

❓ Should this cache be static?

❓ I do not know why originally the builder was set with 128 max connection total and 32 max per route. Is this no longer required?
❗️ Should be modified to go through a privileged action.
❗️ Retrieve properties via privileged actions
❗️ The same was true for the url which is why it was originally stored into a local variable and passed down to the `createSolrHttpClient()` method.
❗️ Let's try to avoid retrieving the solr url too many times. 
❗️ Please saved the value info a local variable to avoid calling `getSolrDir()` twice which ends up doing a privileged action each time.
❓ Why is it no longer private?
❗️ Make sure to re-enable the timeout
❓ Is this class still required?
❓ Should those be hardcoded or auto-generated?
❓ I was not sure if this was still necessary or not even after looking at code not sure why the filter needs to be initialized.

I'm a dummy. An empty array is already all-zeros ????‍♂️
❓ Could you explain what this line does? It seems like it's replacing the code that was removed in `GuestClaimsHandler` but there are a few differences here such as not wrapping the key in a `URI` or putting the information into a `Claim` object.
☝️ good point. Consider creating new class.
☝️ it is easier to find all stuff that needed to be modified if it's marked as `TODO: ...`
Ideally it does hence my question. However I remember a time before first GA where we tried to do a similar thing but failed because of the tooling. I believe versions must be of the format `x.x.x-x.x.x-beta`... ????‍♂️

I missed a line but this should be fully addressed now ????‍♂️ 
⭐️ I like the use of extract method here! ???? 
❗️ Cache the value for the KEY_STORE_PASS property and re-use it. We need to avoid calling the access controller with the same privileged action many times for the same thing.
❗️ See above comment.
❗️ This leads to multiple calls to the access controller with privileged actions as the same values are required in many places.
❗️ This also internally calls `getCoreDir()` which means we are going through the access controller multiple times for the same info.
✏️ Annotate the method with `@Nullable`
❗️ Must have a privileged action to retrieve system properties.
❗️ If you intend to use optional to account for `null` being returned by `getProperty` than you should use `Optional.ofNullable()` to avoid the NPE.
❓ Should you not re-use the `getProperty()` method?
✏️ This whole method could be replaced with `IOUtils.copy()`
❗️ Properties should be retrieved via privileged actions.
❗️ ❗️ ❗️ \I think you wanted:\`sourceType != \"binary\" && sourceType != \"local\"`\not:\`sourceType != \"binary\" && sourcePath != \"local\"`

✏️ I'd yank this out since you're using GH Issues. In fact I'd consider a template like we used for [ACD](https://github.com/codice/acdebugger/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) instead.\\Especially the `Fixes: #XXX` field which is very hel
spidey sense says that this should be a method ON a model (`m.ToView` or `m.NewView` or whatever) but i don't care too much ????‍♀️

✏️ You should fix the inconsistent spacing with the items above. Probably remove all the spaces between \\```\AttributeRegistry\ConfigurationApplication\NoteUtil\QueryTransformer\```
✏️ If you're gonna use `final` stick with it. You can change 3-4 variables in this function to final.
✏️ 	The pair of metacards in this function should be called `existing` and `updated` or `existingWorkspace` and `updatedWorkspace`.

This is failing on the CI even though it's working on my Windows 10 laptop and my Linux workstation at home ????‍♂️. Does anybody have an idea why this is the case?

This seems fine though it'd be nice to have tests in the fields package given we test tons of other values there ????‍♂️. At this point it might be worth consolidating the fields package with sqlgen anyway.
⚠️ `url` e.g. `https://example.com` must be set in you config file for Disqus to work.
Again this seems long to be on one line ????‍♂️ 
No real need to move it to its own addon IMO - certainly not at this point anyway. It's a small thing and doesn't see much usage even in `ember-polaris` ????‍♂️ 
Hahaha then don't mention it at all ☺️ Keep in mind that we need to answer questions for these guides in support. We can't say \"haven't tested it\".

thanks for making the codebase a better place ✨ 
I was about to propose `return nil fmt.Errorf(\"bitbucket: failed to get token: %v\" err)` here when I realised this was modelled after the github connector (or somewhere close). ????‍♂️ Fine.
It's only needed when declaring types for another module e.g. if you would publish a separate package with the types (`speaker-typings`) then you would have to have it ☺️ 
Yeah I think it shouldn't be self-closing ????‍♂️ Does the linter complain if this is left as it was before @vladucu?

That makes sense as to why though my local configuration (managed with `nvm`) is throwing up its arms in confusion: my `node 8` uses `npm 5.5.1` but changing it to `npm 6+` end up with me using `node 10` which is equally incompatible. ????‍♂️ \\That s

❓To reduce the number of arguments could we pass in only the `source` and `pollInterval` arguments? The thread pool shouldn't change between calls and could be passed to the constructor instead and I think it is safe to assume that the time unit is minu
❓Could we use `Instant` instead of `Date` where possible?
❗️`pollInterval` and `pollIntervalTimeUnit` should both be `volatile` since they could be updated by one thread while being read by another.

✏️ Again the property in the root pom could be used.
❓ Did you move these bundles just to make sure bundles came after features in the definition?
❓ Does it make sense to use a common constant for \"DDF\"?
✏️ Why not make the type of `filter` be `SecurityJavaSubjectFilter` instead of just `Filter`? The implementation is tightly coupled to that type. You _might_ even consider renaming the class.
✏️ It'd be good to have this version as a property in the root pom.
❓ Is this method needed? It seems the `sessionListeners` field is not used at all.
❓ I'm curious how this change makes things more stable since we're still relying on the FilterInjector? Is it just because the FilterInjector is more tightly coupled to the Jetty server startup now?
I would kind of have preferred this to be a separate commit but ????‍♂️.

@ryangribble I think this can be ✅ since there is some REST support even though it's not all generated yet.
I agree with everything you wrote ☝️ @jhanggi ????I think `!important` should be reserved only for user stylesheets so I’d definitely seek to get rid of it here.
I'm guessing this was done in order to not trigger `no-use-before-define` but it's actually accessed a bit up which makes that point moot... I'm open to other suggestions for this ☺️ 
Sorry about that my bad ????????‍♂️
To me that just looks like you're tripping the system since that isn't fixing whatever the runtime is but if it works ????‍♀️

✏️ It _might_ be nice to link between these attributes... `For read and write access use <<...` etc \They are all pretty close together admittedly.

❓ Same as my previous point. Why catch the error if you're going to suppress it? This leads to a lot of time spent debugging for errors down the road if we're not careful.

❌ Can we inline this class given that it calls only a method on the visitor?
❌ If we are not visiting the parent directories any more we are not supporting `RelativePath`s which have a length bigger than one right?
❌ Can we only have one constructor? I would expect one constructor taking a `Factory<File>` a `String` fileName and the `Action<OutputStream>`.See my comment about `DirectoryFileTreeFactory` above.

Why that character? I have never seen a circle full of vertical stripes for that. Unicode has white and black circles in a few sizes: `⚪⚫○●`. Those are `MEDIUM? (BLACK|WHITE) CIRCLE`. (Maybe you looked only for character names starting with CIRCLE).
Nice ✨\\I just renamed the variable. Wdyt?
oh the linter didn't get this because it is not imported ✔️ 
❓ Did you mean to leave off `-noverify`?
❗️ Are you sure the value is 1000000 and not 1048576 (i.e. 1024 * 1024)
✏️ Should make that value a constant and should it be 5242880 (i.e. 5 * 1024 * 1024)?
❓ Should we cache `metacard.getMetadata()` to avoid retrieving it twice?
❗️ Should extend privileges to read this property
❗️ Should add tests for when the configured value is not numeric
✏️ Should make that value a constant
✏️ You can provide a default value with `getProperty`.\\https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#getProperty-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-
✏️ Since this matches the default value I would suggest commenting this line out.
❓ Why limit this to megabytes?  Any reason not to make this bytes?  That would give more control and allow us to remove the conversion code.  I would not think bytes would be a problem since this is an advance option.
❗️ `System.getProperty` is a synchronized call.  You do not want to call this every time `addFields` is called.  This value should be read and cached in the constructor or a static block.
❓ Is this threadsafe? If multiple threads construct this exception concurrently can they step on each other? Would there be a big performance hit creating a new `Gson` or a new `GsonBuilder` + `Gson` each time through instead?
❓ Confirming that we're still getting jacoco to run. I suspect this was orphaned here long ago and didn't need to remain but it'd be good to know that nothing has changed in that regard.
???? I remember needing that on older versions of Node on Windows but I completely forgot why exactly. We could take it out I'm sure it'll still run.... ????‍♂️ 
☝️ \"Hackathon\" is still in \"Ineligible Persons\"!
❓ Should these also be static too? The one in the file above is. Or should that one not be static?
✏️ I would replace `Default is 5242880` with `Default is 5MB` for clarity
❓ I don't think size can ever be larger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` unless you parse it as a long. It will overflow
❓ 	Should we use scaled units instead of `px`?

✏️ Could put this in `@After` to make sure every test cleans up in the future.
❓ Should we add another portion to the filters. Like `id = 123 AND title = mTitle`? Just to make sure additional filters are still applied for get by ids.
✏️ Should we have a test case that is `id = mCardId AND title = notMyTitle`. That should return no results even though the id matches right?
❓ Should this be `CommonParams.FQ`?
✏️ Is this check and assertion necessary? Won't the last query in this test catch this? If it is necessary should use something like `assertThat(\"Metacard creation failed for metacard with title: \" + metacardTitle id.isPresent() is(true))`
this is a great change. but…while we're at it what if we changed the delimiter too so remove a tiny bit of escaping?\\```php\'~<!--\\s+/wp:' . preg_quote( $block_name '~' ) . '\\s+-->~'\```\\just a thought but it only saves one escape ????‍♂️ 
This is much cleaner than having the routes in the top component. Every component has one job. ✔️

✏️ You don't need this check because if `whitelistedMetacardTypes` is empty then there will be nothing to filter out and it will ultimately return the same thing
✏️ You use 'whitelisted' here and 'whiteListed' your method signatures.
✏️ super nit the parameter here should be whiteListedMetacardTypes unless that's a style preference and you're doing that to distinguish between the param and the member. But i think using 'this.' does that already
❌ \\Also we should make it so this is caught by the linter. See https://github.com/dydxprotocol/node-service-lib-dev/blob/master/.eslintrc.yaml#L17
Nice catch.  Oddly it looks fine in my browser.  I wonder how you even noticed a difference. ????‍♂️   It appears that all the previous lines have a single tab followed by a bunch of spaces. The last line is two tabs with fewer spaces.  I'll make that cons
I'm not sure if this `$(inherited)` is appropriate here - maybe there is a better place to put that ????‍♀️ 
It's funny that we removed everywhere in the code that used it but we still injected it into the app.  ????‍♂️ 
❓Should we add the attribute name in the message?
❗️Re-assigning to the for-each loop variable (`value` in this case) is usually bad practice. Someone could easily miss the fact that it's been re-assigned in the future and introduce a hard to find bug.
❓Could we do `for (byte[] value : element.getValue())` instead and not have to cast on L62?
❗️We should consider adding the following tests:\- `ObjectElement.getValue()` is empty\- `ObjectElement.getValue()` contains `null` values\- `ObjectElement.getValue()` contains empty or invalid `byte[]` i.e. that cannot be unmarshalled
❓Any reason we're checking the type here? It looks like `getValue()` only returns a `List<byte[]>` so this shouldn't be necessary. We could consider checking that `value != null` instead.
❓Can we assume that the value was base64 encoded? Should we make the message less specific?
❓Could we replace those two assertions with this?\```suggestion\      assertThat(resultMap hasEntry(entry.key() entry.getValue()));\```\\Could also try this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2509293/map-equality-using-hamcrest.
❗️We should catch `RuntimeException` here as well to account for unexpected problems (e.g. value isn't `Serializable`) deserializing the value.
✏️ Might want to hold off on this PR until #219 has been merged.
✏️ Same comment about waiting for #219 
✏️ So you don't actually need to perform this test since...\\`StringUtils.repeat(\"a\" -2) = \"\"`\\This method can be...\```\private static String getZeroPaddedCoordinateString(String input) {\    return StringUtils.repeat(ZERO MAX_COORDINATE_LENGTH
❓Since `0` could be a special case should we set the limit to something like `1` or `10` and have the `mockAttribute.getValue()` return something larger than that to make sure the limit is properly enforced?
❗️This is a very safe test ???? 
❗️We need to pass in a real `SolrInputDocument` when we call `addFields()` not a mock otherwise the assertion below will never fail.
❓Should we enforce some kind of limits here e.g. > 0 bytes < 50MB?
✏️ Since the default is defined by a constant we may want to refer to the constant instead of putting the actual value here. This way we will avoid someone changing the constant value and not updating this comment.
❗️We should do this instead:\```suggestion\    assertThat(solrInputDocument.getFieldValue(\"lux_xml\") is(notNullValue()));\```
❓Wonder how much we should \"advertise\" this system property. For instance we don't mention `catalog.maxPageSize` anywhere. How likely is it that an admin would need to change the default value? @brendan-hofmann @beyelerb @pklinef thoughts?
@CKGrafico this too ⬆
❓Is it ok to hardcode this? @codice/security 
Well that section was breaking for some reason... moving it fixed it. \Moving it back worked too. ????‍♂️ \My preview looks fine but let's be sure to look at the CI output and see if it broke again over there. 
I agree we talked about changing it but the specifics of the templating CLI conspire against us ☹️.

❓ Do we need to start `commons-io`and `commons-collections` bundles with `admin-graphql` since it does not embed them? Or maybe just use the `apache-commons` feature from kernel feature file.
❓ Why move admin-configurator out of here? admin-query-api has a dependency on the admin-configurator-api. Looks like we might be able to remove the `admin-configurator-actions-api` and `admin-configurator-api` dependencies from `admin-query-api` pom?
❓ Why is this one install auto and everything else is manual? This only applies when hot deploying this feature right?
❓ Should this be done in the `getLdapConfigurations` method?
❓ Why not inherit the parents groupId? May be easy to unknowingly get dependency conflicts with the `ddf.features` group in DDF since `testing` and `dev` seem pretty generic. If we want to keep this maybe consider renaming artifacts of sub modules to `que

❓ Do we need to do any kind of validation on the list of metacard types and each metacard type being read in (e.g. length only characters no empty values etc.)?
❓ Should we `trim` the types before putting them in the set?
❓ Should we add a comment explaining what this property does?
❓Should we put constraints on the value e.g. `0 < x < 30000`?
❓I'm curious to know why we decided to use `Failsafe` here instead of https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility which we usually what we use in component and integration tests?
❓Should we share those constants with the unit tests? If we do and the value is changed by mistake by a dev or by a bad merge the unit tests will still pass even though the value is now wrong.
❓ Should we log `commitNrtMetacardType` and `commitNRtCommitWithinMs` for debugging purposes?
✏️ `Nrt` instead of `NRt` to be consistent with the other variable name on L135?
❓ Why do we go through all the work of converting to AttachmentInfo? The CatalogService has a `parseParts` method that could do the parsing without the conversion.

✏️ Using `com.github.npathai.hamcrestopt.OptionalMatchers` this could be written as:\```suggestion\    assertThat(id OptionalMatchers.isPresent());\```

❓ Does that mean that if only one metacard out of all specified requires an Nrt commit that all of them will be done that way? Should we split the metacards into 2 sets?
✏️ nit ...  It might be more optimal to use the `toInt()` method that accepts a default value instead of relying on the `getProperty()` one which returns a string that you are forced to parse after
❓ Should we also tests with a mixture of metacards?

❓ Should we check if it is a list first?\❓ Is there a reason the api doesn't just use a list? or if its supposed to be passed the attribute values perhaps we should pass the attribute itself ?
@paouelle ❓ Would it be safer to bound it to horizontal whitespace only? `split(\"\\h* \\h*\")`
❓ There's a lot of Object in here is there any way we can be more explicit?
➡️ That is correct. The current pull request is just a refactoring. The `SupportsDiagnostics` method doesn't exist in the target branch yet and this location will be minimally updated to use it when it's added.
❓ Why do we need to check if its specifically a boon type of list? does ValueList not implement something more generic like `List`?

English is complicated ????‍♂️

❓ It looks like this method is mocked in the unit tests and never gets tested. Does the urlValidator need to be tested here?
❓ Are file paths URLs? What if someone entered file://...? Would this be handled by `webClient = WebClient.create(resource);`?

✏️ `Unable to update the index. %s is not a supported file path.`
❓ Why do we need to check urlValidator.isValid(resource) in this method? Can you extract it to a variable so that you don't need to check it multiple times?
❓ Do you need to check if it is a valid URL here if you already know that the string is \"allCountries\"?
????‍♂️ How embarrassing
There's a couple of other tests that are breaking as we need to stub out the UI store (`set()` and `reset()`) ????‍♂️

☝️ this way you will have only one wrapping HOC instead of two.
I'm fine with leaving it in if other people find it useful ????‍♂️ 
❗️ That might actually be a problem to introduce default interface methods after the APIs have been released. This is the kind of thing that can cause invalid classes or incompatible classes at runtime.
✏️ Avoid retrieving the description twice. Call `ocd.getDescription()` once and cache it
❗️We need to remember to increase the concurrency level of the cache since it gets updated by all the futures.
❓Instead of using `Optional<T>` here should we use a `Function<T T>`? This would allow us to do something like this for the content type cache and keep the last set of values in the map instead of removing them:\```\SourcePoller<Set<ContentType>> cont
✏️  This is too big for a lambda.  Extract to a method and use a method reference instead.
✏️ This method is getting very long.  Please break it up into multiple methods.
✏️ Returning `Optional` from this method is fine but having the cache return an `Optional` with a null check and `isPresent` check is a code smell. \\❓ Is there a reason you did not just store the value in the cache?
❓ Why are you using `T` instead of `SourceStatus`?  It should be strongly typed.
A little awkward how some of the hidden ANSI escape sequences end up nested in other tags but it works ????‍♂️ . i.e. I expected the inner span with ` style=\"display: none\"` to come after the `</b>` tag when displaying `[INFO]` in a colorized Maven build

Prettier felt strongly about this. ????‍♂️

✏️ 	It might be cleaner / more readable to factor this out into it own helper function
✏️ 	Can this ternary be refactored to only wrap the `fa-home`/`fa-cloud` classes? I think it would help simplify this jsx. Something like\`<span className=\"fa source-icon {source.local ? \"fa-home\" : \"fa-cloud\"} />`
✏️  	Can this ternary be replaced with an if block since the truthy portion is empty?
❓ Isn't this method only ever going to be used when loading the properties from the file system? So won't this always happen when using this method?
????‍♀️ I defer to the @codice/ui reviewers to decide if that is necessary.
Newer version of React requires this thing be defined too but Enzyme still doesn't so added it to our polyfills.  ????‍♂️

This is fixed. ✅
I like that approach ❤️ 
Made it into a Class and made it a final one also. ✅
✏️ Move that and the try within the `if (entity instanceof InputStream)`
✏️ `localCrlPath` is not used anywhere else simply set the `crlFile`
✏️ Reverse these 2 lines in case they ever change their implementation. First closing the stream before getting something from it is safer

✏️ We were forced to read streams in a string with Boon because of a bug. Should we take advantage of Gson and read directly from it?

❓ Similar questions about empty nulls and default values. As for dates Boon handles those differently then Gson.

✏️ Prefer Collections over arrays.
❓ Why not just inject the bundle context instead? It doesn't look like you're taking advantage of the dynamic class lookup since all this code is in the same bundle.
❓ A metatype wouldn't need these two permissions either.
❗️ Why are we adding json filesystem parsing instead of just using a metatype config?
❓ Why are you doing the polling and waiting this way? If  you inject a `reference-list` you can just evaluate it in the blueprint callback when your bean is updated. Then you don't even really need a timeout as you're not consuming any cycles in the mea

✏️ I think we should add a destroy method for this so it shuts down properly.
✏️ Might be worth adding tests to make sure every combination of `this.crlByUrlEnabled` and `crlByUrlEnabled` work as expected
✏️ Docs should be updated to reflect sys props not being replaced.

❗️ I think we should fail instead of returning substituted properties as a last resort otherwise this method is very misleading.
❓ Is there any additional information we can give the user to recover from this error?

Changing the severity on error is a bit of an anti-pattern.  I can see why you've done it here but perhaps we need a better way to distinguish better between \"thing broken\" and \"dunno if thing is broken ????‍♀️ \".

Argh another copy-pasted copy of this code ☹ not that I particularly have a better alternative in mind. We don't have a libendless-glib sin-bin for this kind of thing.
You can leave the  Red Hat part out since you wrote this ☺
You can put your name here too ☺
❔ Can we use `<see href=\"uri\"/>` here so the link is preserved as a link in the doc metadata? Also applies to a few other cases.
yeah not sure ????‍♂️

Well `sshfs` should work on \"any\"® provider.
Agreed. ✅ We should add it as property observers instead. That way we can leave the setters for both `contents` and `settings` `public` which will be more transparent to use.
I've seen underscores in various parts of Java things so being somewhat conservative about that character seems worthwhile. I've found a list of vendors but I haven't found any actual lists of `java.vm.name` / `java.vm.vendor` values ☹.\\It seems fair

✏️ Remove support for N/S indicator in the fuzzy detection. 
❗️ Instead of `([0-5]\\\\d)` it needs to be `([1-5]\\\\d)`. The preceding zero case should still be supported since the matcher will match around it.

❌ These should not be here. Having `setOutputDir` here was a mistake that we still haven't fixed. A SourceDirectorySet is just what the name says - a set of source directories. It shouldn't know anything about output.

❕ If this is not currently persisted across restarts we should file a follow-up issue to consider doing so in the future.
❗️ Need to remove the storage location for now. The feature/option can stay (so it's easy to hook up later to the final design) and the default can stay at 120.
❔ Are there tests covering this behavior specifically? It seems important since previews are frequently used.
❕ Return `null` here. The use of `default` suggests to the reader that this is either an unconstrained generic type or a value type but neither is the case for this method. Applies to a few additional places in this method.

❓ Do we really need this setter and the next getter? It provides internal access to data. If it is for testing than make it package private and annotate it with `@VisbleForTesting` otherwise remove those.

Yeah. By removing height: 26 you end up with a computed height of 14px (comes from line-height). So then to make up for this diff we need to add 10 px of padding (since 2 px comes from the border) resulting in a total height again of 26 ????‍♂️

✏️ We might want to add a comment that this version is required for Solr if I am not mistaking ... @pklinef 
❓ Do we still need the public constructor or can it be private?
Fixed ✅
❔  Can this be removed now?
✅I think this is right!
✏️ Should be able to use Spock's native `MockingApi.Spy` factory method here instead of using Mockito. It's fine as it is but would be more idiomatic that way.
Nice use of Regex! ✌️
You can use absolute paths to avoid having these long paths. ✌️
Updated ✅ 
I should actually write these tests ????‍♀️ 
Same here ☝️ 
Ah of course ????‍♂️ 
❓What if we put this under `catalog` instead? Seems like a natural fit since these modules migrate data within the catalog.
i agree that it shouldn't ever be called without a block so i just removed the ✔️ 
rubocop wanted one less line hence the refactor bit. ????‍♀️ 
is it worth making this `[:en]` as done in the initializer below ⬇️
❓ Is there a reason to call `prettify` here? Are we logging the pretty-print response?
✏️ You could substitute `:arrow_right:` (➡️ ) for your `\\>` indicators.
✏️ Should probably put a `TODO` comment here so it is not dropped. 
✏️ This seems like something that could be initialized once - in the ctor or even statically - instead of recalculated on each login call.
❓ Is this class only invoked from within this package?
✏️ Should be able to get this once on instance construction and save the repeated calls to read the system property.
You can use `username` in `TestCommon` instead. It already does that ☝️ 
❗️ System properties do propagate in the Java VM therefore to avoid bleeding them to the next set of tests that might be running inside the same VM we should make sure to reset them.
We should probably go through the whole Xcode app and change where it says Copyright © 2018 Phyllis Wong to Copyright © 2018 Breezy Traveler
Yes! This is so much cleaner! ✨ ???? ???? 
you can create the predicate inline here to do the filtering and avoid the null list ( ❌) 
✏️ Technically this should go inside an `if (LOGGER.isDebugEnabled())` block since it's making an extra query just to log something.
✏️ We should log the request ID too.
✏️ Extra space between SolrCloud and backups.
i elsewhere need a string so it's kind of six of one at this point ????‍♀️ 
Standard ✌️- It'd be awesome if we could refactor this nested conditional. Perhaps the inner if statement can be broken out into a private function?  I'd also be happy to add a commit if that's helpful.
Done! ✅ Thanks for the suggestion ???? 
oh jeebus. ????‍♂️ check it on one side; ignore it on the other. awesome! (i think that was me ????)
❕  Unused code?
❓ Can we make this a `private` field? 
❓ Do we need to filter nulls here? The API doesn't appear to be nullable. 
Ah! Great. I wasn't sure if I just wasn't getting it or not. Looks great now. ❄️ 
❗️ If this is being removed the resultant `etc/forms` directory should also be fixed. Remove this unhelpful file: \https://github.com/codice/ddf/blob/3bb678a0f033f61db2727489b2ad200fd3299da2/distribution/ddf-common/src/main/resources/etc/forms/noop\\T
❗️ Heads up! Your value is not actually going to be concatenated onto these log strings because they do not have any `{}` placeholder symbols. 
❓ If you're going to throw an exception here should we attach the causes from any of the processing errors? So we have the full context of the failure? 
❓ What about the case where some args are null but others are not? It looks like that case is handled gracefully by the loader thus reassigning the loader seems unnecessary. The loader also has all necessary logging to trace what happened. 
❓ Can we make this a `private` field? 
✏️ Did an error actually occur or an exception get thrown? I don't have a strong preference but I think this is meant for actual system issues that occur when running a command. \\This case strikes me as a valid outcome for the command. Not an error cas

I wish wrapperName was available like sets! But it's not ☹️ Just the values themselves: `{\"0\": \"foo\" \"1\": \"bar\"}`
yeah this API seems nice ✌????
❓ Can't we just use a normal mock here instead of writing our own?
❓ Same suggestion as above.

❌ this should just be:\\```js\if (ledgers.includes(\"bitcoin\")) {\    await test_lib.btc_generate();\}\```
Take it back `bash` is an alias for `shell`. Still this is not bash ☺️ 
❓ What is causing this inconsistency? Is it the data layer in Solr? The UI keeping state incorrectly? Instead of supporting both styles we should simplify if possible and figure out what the root cause is. 
❗️ Now that `PUT` is no longer overloaded to perform the tasks of both create and update we should enforce proper HTTP semantics and split this method into two. Each can validate things a bit more harshly and fail fast if the request is not well formed 
Sounds fine to me. Yea it's odd. The formalist in me is like ????and the pragmatist is like ????‍♂️.

✔️ -- so for each element of the list it loops through the entire list again resulting in n*n operations
✔️ -- well spotted that for each element of the list you have to run a linear search
✔️  -- however it would be good to find a source other than Wikipedia e.g. follow up the sources cited there.
✔️ -- specifically by \"higher complexity\" here you mean \"grows faster as n increases\"
✔️ -- though strictly speaking \"logarithmic time\" is O(log n) not O(n log n)
✔️ -- however the intermediate complexity should be O(n log n + n) -- or if you prefer O(n(log n + 1)) -- not O(2n log n).
✔️ -- but n log n grows faster than n as n grows large so this can be simplified further to O(n log n) -- ignore all but the fastest growing term

❓ Why did this change?
❗️ \ `size_t(-1)` makes this condition false.\ `status = RST_AGAIN` returned from `sys_recvmsg(…)` is not handled here.
This is annoying. `$pointer` doesn't have a type hint; adding a `@param` here sees it deleted by the fixer. ????‍♂️

Shouldn’t that be an error? Or at least a warning ⚠️?
❌ add `thunkify` to the removed methods list here. The deeper explanation can live in the ramda upgrade bullet (or just removed or consolidated?). Blocking because I think the changelog is critical to keep up-to-date for future us.
Maybe haven't had enough ☕️ but I don't fully understand why the `-????/2` is needed ... but with different scale ranges (e.g. `[-???? ????]` `[0 2*????]`) the axis was always off by 45° without this.

❓Any reason we have both a `DescribableKey` and a `SourceKey`?
❗️Meeting the general contract of the `equals()` when using sub-classes (`DescribableKey` and `SourceKey` here) is tricky so I would recommend not sub-classing if possible.
❗️We need to clearly define when and how this method will be called (e.g. can `source` be `null`) and how the sub-classes are expected to behave and return.
❓Curious to know why we're making the methods here and in other classes `final`.
❗️We should clearly document what the expectation is on `source` in `SourcePollerRunner` i.e. whether it can be `null` or not and make sure all sub-classes handle this the same way. Right now this class throws an exception if `source` is `null` but `

❓We may want to log something here so we know something went wrong. Probably something to carefully consider every time we catch exceptions to make sure troubleshooting is easier in production.

✏️ Instead of operating on both the key and trust stores in parallel could easily refactor a method that could read/process a keystore and then invoke it twice once for keystore and once for truststore. That would lead to a shorter method overall.

❓ Maybe add an inline comment about why the `reverse()` is needed? 
❓ Can we rename this to `CesiumLayerOrdering` to be consistent with the exported name? Since it's not being used across multiple map types I think that is safe to do.

❓ Could you do this instead? \```\return [ ...previousLayerOrder layerId]\```\**Answer**: No because there is no guarantee that appending results in the correct order. 
❓ Could we add efficient validation regarding the superset property of `cur` at the beginning of each of these ordering helper functions? If verifying that is not cheap maybe checking **once** in the component itself before all this layer manipulation be

✏️ Avoid calling `filterServiceReference.getProperty(key)` twice
❓ Should we trace the exception too?
❓ By convention in DDF we mark methods and parameters with `@Nullable` if they can be `null`  otherwise it is expected that they cannot be.
✏️ Annotate with `@Nullable`
✏️ _periodically call {@link Poller#pollCurrent()}_ instead?
✏️If we keep this sub-class we should add JavaDoc comments.
✏️ \```suggestion\      LOGGER.warn(\"{}. Try restarting to system.\" message e);\```
✏️ `SourceStatus` was a little clearer.
❓Should we call this method something like `getValueLoaders()` instead?
✏️ \```suggestion\ * Thrown by {@link Poller#pollCurrent(long TimeUnit ImmutableMap)} to indicate that some of the polled items could not be updated.\```
✏️ \```suggestion\    Validate.isTrue(pollIntervalMinutes >= MINIMUM_POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES \"pollIntervalMinutes argument may not be less than %d minutes. Not updating the poll interval.\" MINIMUM_POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES);\```
✏️ We should add an `@param` for `causes` and explain what the map contains.
✏️ _a value ~a~ which_
❓What was the reason behind extracting this sub-class from `Poller` since as far as I know we don't expect any other `Poller` sub-classes?
✏️`pollIntervalMinutes` instead to make it clear this will not just be used for the first poll?
✏️ Since this is meant to poll sources I wonder if we shouldn't be a little more explicit here and say something like this to make things clearer:\```suggestion\ * @param <K> type of the unique key used to identify the items to poll e.g. {@link Sourc

`Component`  didn't want to rename the top level imports ????‍♀️

:bomb: We are using `eslint` for linting. Do not use `jshint` ⚠️ 
✏️ `Affects versions` may be more appropriate since someone may write a bug against multiple versions.
❓Should this parameter be named `action`? If this was a `CqlAction` then it would already have a display name right?
✏️ Consider using the three-arg version to separate the endpoint logic from the response format: `get(\"/transformers/metacard\" (req res) -> descriptors.getMetacardTransformers() GSON::toJson)`.
✏️ We probably should set the content-type on the responses.
Speaking of prettier...  ????‍♂️ 
Oh right ????‍♂️ 
The component is new but not the platform. ????‍♂️

✏️ `itemsToPoll` instead?
✏️ Would this be clearer?\```suggestion\   * @param itemsToPoll the current item keys to poll along with their corresponding loader {@link Callable<V>}s with which to retrieve the latest value and update the cache.\```
❓We may want to do this here:\```suggestion\      } catch (final RejectedExecutionException | RuntimeException e) {\```
❓Instead of only extracting the logging call in the `warn()` method should we move the conditional as well and rename the method `executorsNotShutdown()` instead?
✏️ Declaring an inner class in the middle of another class is a little odd. Should we declare it at the top or bottom instead?
❓Instead of keeping track and returning the load count from `startLoads()`  to use it in the for loop could we use `while (completionService.poll() != null)` and get rid of the extra variable and logic?
❓To keep the code a little simpler and since `SourceRegistry. getCurrentSources()` and `SourcePollerRunner. getCurrentValueForSource()` filter out `null`s already should we just document that this method will never be called with a `null` `source` and g
✏️ Add description:\```suggestion\  /**\   * Gets the set of {@link ContentType} available from a given `source`.\   *\   * @throws NullPointerException if {@code source} is {@code null}\   */\```
❓Would this work instead?\```suggestion\          final Set<ContentType> cachedContentTypes =\            contentTypesCache.getCachedValueForSource(source)\            .orElseGet(() -> {\              LOGGER.debug(\"Unknown ContentTypes for source id=

❓Isn't this going to stop the whole loop as soon as one source is missing from the cache? Is that what we want? Should we log return an empty set instead and keep going?
✏️ We should keep the `private` methods at the bottom to keep the `public` `protected` package-private and `private` method order.
❓How about this instead?\```suggestion\    return (boolean) sourceStatusOptional\        .map(s -> s == Status.AVAILABLE)\        .orElseGet(\          () -> {\            LOGGER.debug(\"Unknown source status for source id={}\" source.getId());\    
❗️We should document what the default implementations of `handleTimeout()` and `handleException()` do.
✏️ _because the ~the~ source_
❓Since `handleTimeout()` and `handleException()` are called by a single thread sequentially does this method needs to be `synchronized`?
❓What was the reason behind extracting this sub-class from `Poller` since as far as I know we don't expect any other `Poller` sub-classes?
❗️We should have this before the `catch (Throwable)`:\```\  catch (VirtualMachineError e) {\    throw e;\  }\```

➡️ Resolving this as **won't fix** because the suggested refactoring would complicate the code flow for multiple entry points but isn't actually needed for performance.

`.ToChar('a' + ♥a - 1)` should also work and you will omit the magic value 96.\BTW won't the `♥a.ToString()` do exactly the same?

✏️ Might want to consider the shorter license header we used for the [SAML-CTK](https://github.com/codice/saml-conformance/blob/master/codice.license.kt)
✏️ Same problem with running the parse logic twice.
✏️ In the case of a date and not an unknown or N/A date this ctor is going to attempt to parse it twice: once in the validation method and then again here. I don't have a great solution off the top of my head for this.
✏️ I think just log this `documentedTag`.
❗️ Your `equals` and `hashCode` methods are not equivalent as this method includes the `parsedDate` in the generation of the hash code.
✏️ Not sure I wouldn't use a string template for this instead of concatenation.

Swift-y version ☝️ Since the parameters define an enum type you can drop the type when setting its value and use the shorter dot syntax version. You can also drop the parameters `range` and `locale` because they already have the default value `nil`.

When I tested this locally this return statement always returned `false` (so no alert was displayed) because `alertPresented` was nil. We could add a nil-coalescing operator to the statement above ☝️ to fix it. e.g.\\`let alertPresented = UserDefaults.

I should have thought about this ????‍♂️
❔  Why did all of these break? Can they be fixed?
```suggestion\      `❌ Error: Couldn't fix locale ${locale.toUpperCase()} due to differences on locale size. \\n ${referenceLocale.toUpperCase()} has ${referenceLocaleLength} keys. Although ${locale.toUpperCase()} has ${localeLength} keys.`\```
Yes which is a problem because the panel doesn’t follow the touch point (see [this comment](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/pull/606#discussion_r257082487)) but once the fix would be applied `1` would be positioned as show in the drawing ⬆️ and it sh
❓  Can you add one more test (keeping all the current ones) which is like this one but has the `.Where` indented twice instead of once? In this case the expected indentation would end up as 16.
❓ I'm confused about why these extension functions are necessary. Is it because you want to call `setPrefix` even if `prefix` is null or empty string?
❓ Would it be overkill to trace log the attribute's `localName` here?
✏️ Nit: It bothers my obsessive tendencies that there is parity between the builder package and corresponding \"buildee\" package for all except for this one since the `producers` package is nested under `resource` in one but not the other.
✏️ I'm guessing you don't need some of these ???? 
❓ Why are some of these fields nullable and some (e.g. `subjectCoverage`) aren't?
✏️ I think the README should probably be updated with more information. It's pretty bare right now. Some usage examples may be nice.
❓ This strikes me as a dangerous way to loop over this. Is there any likelihood that the DDMS could be malformed enough to cause this loop to execute more times than it should?
These are  great things to link to thank you @guineveresaenger for following through on this. ❤️

The unique one-liner looks something like this:\\```js\const unique = values.filter((value i list) => list.indexOf(value) === i)\```\\In other words: only the values for which the index of the value is the index of the _first_ one. ✨ 
It doesn't look like we're using the index here so could this be a `for..of` loop?\\```js\for (const commit of commits) {\  // ✨\}\```
Yeah just mentioning since we normally use a `organization.projects.forEach()` style loop but i don't really mind either way so ????‍♀️
✏️I'd recommend getting rid of `newDataManager` and inlining it (and using String.format instead of concatenation):\`String newHostValue = oldHostValue.replaceAll(LOCALHOST_DATA_MANAGER String.format(\"%s-%s\" newInternalHost DATA_MANAGER));`

❓From the API we will expose this as \"total run time\" for the configuration but would something like \"last run duration\" be more useful ie don't accumulate these? I'm thinking the more runs the less meaningful \"total run time\" becomes.
I prettified the code a bit but this is great.\I made the index++ change and as a general note please pay attention to code formatting:\`while(...){`  ➡️  `while (...) {`\✔️ (means I finished reviewing this method/section)
sharing a result between different methods is not recommended\it is enough to use boolean as a return type here.\✔️

Sure happy to ✌️
This can be handy for debugging but probably better added when need arises ☺ 
Updated now the tests are a lot easier to read now imho ☺️
Since we're already putting the sub function and props into an array we could just add the `cancel` function as another element if that's not too confusing to keep track of ????‍♂️ 
True. However the cop is now configurable. So technically that is a change to the user.\\Better safe than sorry? ????‍♂️ 
I'm seeing a small linting error here:\\```\54:22  error  'getByValue' is assigned a value but never used  no-unused-vars\\✖ 1 problem (1 error 0 warnings)\```\\We could probably remove that variable if not needed.

Function `warn()` doesn't return anything which pisses the linter off. ????‍♂️

This is great but also made me ????‍♀️ at the number of incredibly long test strings in waste carriers when I could have just done a `* 32` instead! So much easier to read.\\However would it be even clearer if we just did something like `\"A\" * 256`?

✏️ Class documentation and copyright notice
❓ Should we define `5` as a constant? Actually the whole string representation of 5 minutes in seconds should probably be defined as a constant.
❓ Shouldn't we add the duration time even if it failed? In a failure wouldn't there still have been records replicated potentially?
✏️ 1 minute should probably be defined as a constant for clarity
✏️ Class documentation and copyright notice. Maybe double check all files for that.
❓ Are we not creating a new record each time we are condensing instead of creating one final one at the end of condensing all those we are iterating here?
❗️ The problem in doing this here is that you are in the middle of an iteration controlled by `scheduleReplication()` which means that the next iteration will be interrupted again. Typically at a low level like this it is better to throw back an `Interru
✏️ The above block nested inside the `execute()` should be moved to a private method
❓ Won't these records (saved at the same time) be picked up by the next poll?

❓ Alternatively we could call the query response transformer by constructing a `SourceResponse`. That way we don't have to duplicate any logic. 
✏️ We should avoid using `Tuples` and `Triples`. They remove a lot of context from your data and are difficult to work with. I would declare a`Set<AttributeDescriptors>` here instead to remove a layer of abstraction. 
✏️ This can be simplified to...\\```\private HashSet<String> buildSet(String[] attributes) {\    return new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(attributes));\}\```
✏️ We should only need one of each `BasicTypes` for testing purposes. 
✏️ The `name` of the `MetacardType` could also be `null` in this case. 
✏️ What is a \"normal metacard\"? This could be renamed to just `metacard`. 
❗️ This module needs to be renamed to something more generic. 
✏️ Delete this commented out argument. 
✏️ All of this functionality could be moved out of `setup`. Given that these are unit tests we are the masters of this domain. So we don't need layers of abstraction like this. \\`String[]` -> `List<String>` -> `Set<String>`\\We can just declare it f

We use `with_for_update(read=True)` in one of our other queries would it be useful here? ????‍♀️

~❓ Maybe I'm misunderstanding what's being done here but why would you clear the cache when the query is saved?~ Nevermind 
this split will return a single value if the path is `0/` which is an invalid path but when it goes through the digitOnly pattern will pass as a valid one. Curiously if you send `/0` will split into `\"\"`and `\"0\"` which will be properly rejected. ????‍♂️ 
Should we preserve this path under test utils? ????‍♂️

Since you're checking if `cursor != null` Typescript ????does not require you to use the `!`  ❗️ . You can remove the bang now.

That's alright by me. It looks like all of the SASL implementations are making a similar assumption so ????‍♂️ 
❓ Is there a reason you didn't create two different private methods? One for generating the associated data and another for storing it to properties? It seems feasible from looking at it but I could be missing something.
✏️ You don't need to pass `keysetHandle` into the `getAssociatedData` method since `keysetHandle` is a field right?
❗️ I don't think we want to log a value that we were encrypting since it could be sensitive information.
~❗️ I don't think we want to log a value that we were encrypting since it could be sensitive information.~ Nevermind you're logging the encrypted value.
❓ Would it be better to avoid reporting a diagnostic in this case?
Refactoring this into two methods would probably look a lot cleaner. The only reason I didn't do it is because I didn't think about it ????‍♂️ 
❗️We need to clearly state that only the list of child nodes is thread safe and that it assumes all other attributes are assumed to only be changed by a single thread at a time.
❗️Move `static` and then non-static fields are at the top and make sure methods are in the `public` `protected` package-private and `private` order.
❓Shouldn't we use `AsyncFileAlterationObserver.load()` here instead?
❓Instead of checking this for every delete should we do this check in the `listFiles()` method and fail there if we run into a problem?
✏️Keep package-private after `public` and `protected` ones.
✏️ `initializeFileEntry()` instead?
✏️`private` methods should be last.
❓This makes me wonder. Do we need to do this anywhere else we call `checkNetwork()`?
❗️Since we have classes implementing this we should add JavaDoc comments on the interface and methods.
❗️We should add `@Nullable` on the return type and explain when `null` will be returned. We could also consider returning `Optional<T>` instead of returning `null` if that makes sense.
❗️The `IllegalArgumentException()` needs a message and we may also want to log something if we were to keep the `null` checks.
❓Could we make this constructor `private` and have clients use the `load()` method instead? This would provide a single common way of creating this class and would allow us to remove these `null` checks here.
✏️ We may want to add a note here saying that files will _not_ be checked if there are still files to process.
❓Are those limitations or more things to be aware of?
❓What's the reason for not creating the `fileSystemPersistenceProvider` and `jsonSerializer` in the constructor instead of doing this here and checking for `null`?
❗️We should add `@Nullable` on the return type and a comment explaining how this method is used and when it could return `null`.
❗️Synchronizing on `processing` here doesn't necessarily guarantee exclusive access to the `processing` object i.e. another thread might still be allowed to call `getAndDecrement()` within this synchronized block depending on how `AtomicLong` is impleme
❓Do we still need this? Doesn't seem to be used.
✏️`fileName` instead of `remaining`?
❗️Instead of converting the `Path` to a `String` we should just return the `Path` object and have the callers use that instead. That way no one should have to deal with file separators and can use existing `Path` methods.
✏️We should consider doing this before the `while` loop to make it more obvious that this is a guard check.
❓Since this is only called from the `AsyncFileAlterationObserver` and that class already knows about the root node should we put this method on that class instead of here and have to \"walk up the tree\"?
❗️We need to use a synchronized collection here e.g. `ConcurrentSkipListSet`.
✏️ use `interface` instead of `type`
✏️ would `id === 'anyText'` work?
That's something I could not tell you even if I wanted. ????‍♂️ \I can look into refactoring that

I'm not a semver parsing expert but our sample artifacts changed because our jquery `2.1.1` inclusion changed. Shouldn't it not have changed ?\\**Before**\✅ 2.1.1 < 3.0.0-beta1\✅ 2.1.1 > 1.12.3\\**After**\✅ 2.1.1 < 2.2.2\✅ 2.1.1 >= 1.12.3\\????

❗️ Not returning a boolean here
✏️ There is an opportunity to create a base interface and classes for managers and implement most of these methods in one places assuming we standardize their names
❗️ Not returning a boolean here
❓ What happen if a new id is used with an existing name?\❓ What happen if the id already exist and the name is in use by another replicator config?
✏️ For consistency we should call both managers the same way
✏️ Should clarify that this will overwrite any existing site with the same id. What about duplicate name used by another site? Shoudn't that be detected somehow or are site names not necessarily unique?
❗️ We might want to also retrieve the version and save it in the `writeToMap()`
✏️ I would suggest adding `Stream<ReplicationSite> sites()`
❓ Shouldn't this be in the data package with the other persistable?
✏️ Keep a documentation history for the versions which will help understand when a particular version was introduced and for what.
✏️ Since this is the only place we actually use the `getType()` method you could actually get rid of it completely and replace this with a call to `getPersistenceType(persistable.getClass())` or simply move the `getPersistenceType()` as a static method i
❗️ A default constructor should set the `id` to a newly generated one
❓ What happens if the name is changed to one that is already in use by another site? Are names not necessarily unique? \❗️ I think using `edit` and `save` makes this really confusing. What happens if the id doesn't exist do we create a new one and if so
❓ Wouldn't this be more of a create since no identifiers is specified? What happens if there is another site with the same name or are names not necessarily unique?
✏️ Document that the object must be one created via this interface otherwise an IllegalArgumentException is thrown
❓ Should we expose this or simply auto-generate one whenever a new persistable is created?
✏️ SiteManager would benefit from having a `Stream<ReplicationSite> sites()` here.
I just removed it entirely and the tests using it pass. ????‍♂️ 
✏️ For consistency with the site manager I would call this one `getConfigs()`. I would also suggest adding a `Stream<ReplicatorConfig> configs()`
❗️ This is also inconsistent with the `ReplicatorConfigManager` one since there we have a `delete(ReplicatorConfig)`.  Wither have one or the other or both but not a mixture like this.
❓ Is there a better way to get the system's keystore @stustison?

❓ Is there any reason for wrapping the `data` `InputStream` as a `BufferedInputStream`?
❓ ✏️  If a signature must be provided when `--include-content` is `true` then this error might be interpreted better as something like:\```\\"You must provide a signature file when the `--include-content` option is specified.\"\```
✏️ If you are looking for some extra test coverage (????) could throw in a negative path test in where the data and signature don't match.

I like the idea of this. Just be careful with recursion (What happens when somebody enters the wrong symbol A LOT of times. You could fill the stack and program crashes ☠️)
✏️ I think this interface still needs the experimental comment block.
❓ Why was this added?
✏️ Super nit (????): Add a new line above the bean tag to separate the references from the bean.
✏️ If `createOcspResponse` on line 168 is throwing an exception as the test expects then this line will never get called and can be removed.
✏️ This interface strikes me as odd because it's named `OcspService` but has no details about an actual OCSP. I think from a design perspective it may make more sense to pull the `ocspServerUrl` field from the implementing class `OcspChecker` into this
✏️ This interface doesn't really explain what will happen if something goes wrong with the OSCP server connection/interaction. Something like\`@return true if the certificates could not be properly checked or if they are not revoked false if any of them
❓ Are we sure there's no way an `IOException` could get caught here that wasn't thrown by this class? If that were to happen the cert check would return true but no admin alert would be sent.

✏️ I don't think you need a constructor here (or even to extend a `React.Component` for that matter). You're not using state so you can just pull up most of the functions out and make this a stateless component.

✏️ Annotate method with `@Nullable`
❓ Why are we stopping at 10 minutes?  Shouldn't we be continuing until it works?\❓ Should we not be re-trying for errors other than when Solr is not available?
❓ Should we be handling `SourceUnavailableException` differently to let Failsafe above retry on these? Maybe a new `ReplicationSourceUnavailableException` or something similar extending `ReplicationException`
❓ How would Failsafe detect errors and retry? From the `convertConfigs()` method it seems to be returning successfully in all situations.

❔ Will a machine learning engineer who is not familiar with the Tatau codebase understand what a train history is?
❔ I could be wrong but I don't think chunk is a commonly-used term in machine learning (or at least not the way we're using it here); could we make this explanation more explicit?
❔ Out of curiosity why does the initialiser accept `net` `optimizer` `loss_fn` etc. as parameters?  In all of the example models I've seen the overridden method ignores these parameters and sets them explicitly.
❕ Also `weights_serializer_class` and `weights_summarizer_class` need documentation.
❔ Could we tighten this up a bit to make it clear that this is a sequence/counter value?
❔ Could we format this as a [list](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#lists-and-quote-like-blocks)?  It will make the Sphinx-generated documentation much easier to read.
❕ This method is pretty important as it builds the PyTorch model; could we include more information here about what this method is used for and when/how the user might need to override it?
❔ An with above could we include expected parameter and (where applicable) return types in the documentation?\❔ Could we also include information explaining at what point in the training lifecycle each method is invoked?
❔ Could we include an explanation as to why it is not recommended to override this method?
❔ Could we also include expected type(s) and example values for each parameter?\???? It might be helpful also to include links to Keras documentation for losses callbacks metrics etc.  That will help other developers understand the context for these pa
❔ Could we include an explanation of what sort of meta information might be included in here and where the meta information came from?
❔ We are using a type hint here (`chunk_dirs: Iterable`) but `get_weights()` puts the expected type in the docstring (`:rtype: list(numpy.array)`); could we make the type hinting consistent?
❔ I think this last line is meant to indicate that `collate_function` is passed via `kwargs`; is that right?
✏️ `s/DataLoadre/DataLoader/`
❕ Overriding the initialiser seems to be a pretty common practice for creating Tatau models; could we also include some instructions for this?  E.g. indicate that the overridden method must invoke the superclass initialiser.
❔ This is easy to overlook; could we put this information in the docstring for the method as well?  It might also be useful to include some example code in the docstring that a ML engineer can use as a starting point.
❔ Could we add more detail to this explanation?  What is the purpose of this parameter?  How should `train` use it?  Think about it from the perspective of a ML engineer who is not familiar with Tatau internal code but needs to customise the training logi
❔ Could we make this a bit more explicit?  E.g. \"Evaluate model accuracy\" or similar.\✏️ Also remove extra space char.
```suggestion\Does this sound like something that sparks joy? ✨Oh--let's talk about the deploy process too.\```\Moving the emoji to the end of the sentence so we don't rely on it for the sentence to read well.

❓ Should we be including `CatalogStores` like [here](https://github.com/codice/ddf/pull/4534/files#diff-0012b61aaa85d40ecb0549a105f7070cR810)?

☝️ this would be a breaking change but makes sense.
❓ Instead of creating this new method why not use the getTypeForFilter() method in the calling class and passing in the filter and getId function?
❓ With the way it is now if a user deleted a config then wanted to delete a site that config was using would they have to wait a minute until the config was polled and actually deleted?
✏️ at first glance I wasn't sure if this meant filter out deleted replications or apply a filter so that I just get deleted replications. `excludeDeleted` or something similar might be more clear.
I would still need to set `success` ????‍♂️

✏️ Don't think this was working since you wrapped it above.
✏️ nit this could be closer to the try catch statement below
❓ It seems like with these changes we can only every be signed into one realm. If that is true shouldn't this only return back a single security token instead of a list?
✏️ Can we put this behind an interface instead so we are leaking all these dependencies into other bundles? It looks like we can return `AuthenticationToken` instead of the impl class from these methods as well.
✏️ Looks like this is being used in one of our feature files. I think it would be worth extracting into a variable.
✏️ I think checking the `subjectList` instead of the `tokenList` would be more clear here
✏️ We could pull the service reference instead of creating a new instance here.
❓ If this fails to parse do we want to still return the token? Or would it be better to return an exception and let the caller handle it?
❗️ This is a bundle I don't think we need to embed this. This should clean up some of these imports below hopefully.
✏️ you can call this feature instead https://github.com/codice/ddf/blob/master/features/utilities/src/main/feature/feature.xml#L40

⚠️ `GetSymbolInfo` is costly in a syntax node analyzer. It's fine when used sparingly but this one is not. This analyzer would benefit _substantially_ from switching to an `IOperation` analyzer. IOperation analyzers run as a group after the binding phase

Lots of jobs seem to use it ????‍♀️. Most of the searches seem to be for \"teacher\" which I'd like to discourage.
good catch. Thanks Tim! We use it like that without properly declaring in bridge ui as well ????‍♂️
I don't think so; I can't imagine any case when a client asks for their own info without just calling `/self`; not worth dealing with until we get some bug report ????‍♂️ 
That's true a polyfill or fallback is on my todo list ☝️ I had thought I'd need to anyway to cater for IE6-7 which doesn't support `postMessage` at all but I've just realised polyfill.io doesn't support them.
but I trust you guys with this decision so this is fine by me ❤️ 
Not really part of this change but should be `Promise<void>` ????‍♂️

❓ info? This seems like developer's info and not customers so debug would be more appropriate
❗️ This attribute seems to be designed to be accessed from multiple threads and as such all access should either be protected by synchronization or be made volatile based on careful considerations.

❓ Would resolving the promise ensure that beyond this point the data is accessible? Is this a synchronization point?

Best practices.  People look at these samples to see how they're supposed to build their app.  I wouldn't suggest someone pin the version in most cases so I wouldn't pin the version in the samples ????‍♂

❓Should we have clearer constraints here? For instance what if the client uses `application/octet-stream` is the service going to accept or reject the request?
❓Should this include the path? What if the product is not coming from a file system but from a web server or some other type of endpoint that doesn't provide a file name?
✏️Since anything after storage could change in the future (workflows relationships etc.) and is not directly related to ingest should we say something like _for validation transformation and storage_ and exclude _query_?
❓What would be the purpose of the title here? What would we do if the product already contains a title? Which one wins?
❓Should this be at least 1?
❓For this API should we update the description and provide sub-codes for cases such as when the product size doesn't match the size attribute or when the product `mimeType` is not supported or is invalid? @paouelle?
❓Where should we indicate what status code is returned when the size provided doesn't match the actual payload size? Do we need to get the payload size at all?
❓Should we use `file-length` or `file-size` here instead? `bytes` could be confused with the actual payload bytes.
❓Just noticed that this is also how @paouelle did it in his spec. Do we really want to couple the spec to the Maven module name? Someone could easily make a change in the pom file without realizing that it will impact the API title as well.

☁️ Remove the type variable? It's always going to be `String`. If we change the definition of `recoveryText` above it would be a breaking change and we'd need to create a `V4` module anyway.
But I also must say I agree with @kraftb in terms of the fact that I've always wanted us to have a whitelist of those against which to validate the `from` argument. Oh well ????‍♂️

✔ Noted as a nice to have tidy-up task
☝️. If implemented I suggests to have an option to skip build process which is important when doing local dev iteration in writing test.
This is now used twice ☝️  Maybe worth making an export import in one of the files.\Same with body or any re-used filed.
what's the point of this one? typedef suggests both are unexpected but looking through the code it looks like we never used groups for the score gauge no matter what.... ????‍♂ 
this code stands out to me but I can't think of any other way to handle this ????‍♂ 
without setting `self.data_sorurces` then `get_tags()` will not do anything since it will be walking over an empty list.  To me that seems like it's required. ????‍♂

❗️ This constant would probably be a good one to put in the interface since it's part of the contract.
✏️  Should we call this `mimeType` or `rawDataMimeType` instead? Otherwise it sounds like this string actually contains some raw data.
❓ Do we need both the constructor's parameter and this method? If we can it might be better to remove this method and keep this instances immutable.
❓ Should we allow the `InputStream` to be changed after creation? That seems a little dangerous.
❓ Can we remove this method and make the instances immutable?
❓ Should we add `constructor arguments` or something similar in the test description?
❗️ We should either make those constants `public` in the class and use them here or keep them `private` and compare with the actual string instead of using the constant.
❓ Since all the `Process*ItemImpl` classes need to implement the `getMetacard()` method should we have a base class that implements it instead of repeating it in all three classes?
❗️ None of the parameters are marked as `@Nullable` so we should check for `null` and throw exceptions when they are. Either that or add `@Nullable` on the parameters that can be `null` and add JavaDoc comments that explain what happens when they are set
❗️ We should compare against the constant here instead of `-1`.
❗️ Since it looks like each of these tests covers a specific constructor we may want to assert all the values and not only a subset.
❗️ Conditionals in tests are usually a smell. I would recommend either splitting this into two separate tests or use the `where` statement to keep track of the expected values and use those in the assertions.
❓ Since none of the values returned by these classes can be `null` should we add `null` checks in the constructors?\\Same comment for all the classes in this PR.
❗️ Probably want to check that `size == UNKNOWN_SIZE || size > 0` and throw an exception if not.
❓ We have \"setters\" and constructor parameters for both `inputStream` and `isModified`. Would it make sense to only keep the constructor arguments and make the instances immutable? Or should we only keep the \"setters\"?
❓ Should we test with more than one metacard to be on the safe side?
❓ Any reason we're checking for an empty/null list here but not in the two other `create*Request` methods?
❓ Keep `private` methods after `public` ones?
❓ Is the actual coverage higher than these? If so we may want to bump those up.
❗️ Shouldn't we also test that the exceptions are handled properly by the `process(UpdateRequest)` method?
✏️  Could probably convert this to a `stream().map(...).collect()`.
❓ Is the actual coverage higher than the defaults? If so we may want to bump those up.
✏️  Any way we could improve the description to capture the fact that this is testing the cases where input is `null` and the list of metacards is `null`? With the current description we almost have to look at the test code to know what's being tested.
❗️ `ProcessResource` should never be `null` per our `ProcessUpdateItem` interface contract so this method should never return `null`.
✏️  `stream().map(...).collect()`?
❗️ Add `RuntimeException` to this list.
✏️  The three `process` methods can be reduced to one:\\```\@Override CreateResponse process(CreateResponse input) throws PluginExecutionException {\    return process(input input -> processingFramework.submitCreate(createCreateRequest(input)));\}\
❗️ If this property is there but is not a `boolean` something is really wrong so we may want to consider logging an error and throwing an exception or at least log a warning.
❗️ We may want to add `RuntimeException` to this list. Also should we just fail the processing if the resource cannot be retrieved and increase the log level to at least info?
❓ Should we test with more than one updated metacard?
❓ Should we test with more than one deleted metacard?
❓ Since this is an internal flag used by the plugin and we need to make sure it never clashes with any other property now and in the future should we make it even more specific e.g. `catalog-async-processing-plugin:post-process-complete` or something l
✏️  Same comment as above regarding the test description.
❓ Missing docstring.
❓ Maybe use some non-routable documentation only IP address  or unresolvable DNS name.
Installing with `pip install --editable .` succeeded.\I guess it's a setuptools bug?\❓ Maybe add a note about recommended installation method to  README
❓ `incremental` should probably be listed as a direct dependency in setup.py then.

❓ Should we use `overwritten` instead of `overridden` here?
❗️ Before we create the FBOS and do all the above work shouldn't we first make sure the `ContentItem` isn't already in the set? Otherwise I'm pretty sure we could end up creating FBOS that are not going to be used.
✏️ Given the number of different interfaces and classes involved in this should we ask @ricklarsen to create a figure (e.g. class diagram flow diagram etc.) that shows how all these things relate to one another?
❓ Should we log those update failures at `debug` level? If something doesn't get updated as expected nobody would know and be able to address the problem. Thoughts?
❓ Add `@Nullable` on `processResource`?\❗️ We may also want to mention that `isModified` default to `true`. This applies to all the other `ProcessItemImpl` sub-classes as well.
✏️ `Copied` is only one `p`.
❓ Should we give an example of how this can be done? Could be as simple as referring to our default in-memory implementation.
❓ Shouldn't we make sure the `tfbos` is properly cleaned up and the `contentItem` removed from the `contentItemsToUpdate` set if we get here?\\We should make sure we have a unit test for this scenario if that's the case.
❗️ Same potential problem here with the `metacardsToUpdate` set. We probably can't guarantee that the metacards returned generate proper hash codes here so we should consider using a `TreeSet` with a custom `Comparator` instead.
❓ `null` is a valid value for `qualifier` for the `ContentItemImpl` constructor. Any reason we've added that check here?

The benefit is that sometimes a `.back` file already exist. So if one exist we would overwrite the existing one. With the random string we ensure that there is no such file and we are good to go ✌️

❓ Since we only have one implementation of this interface could we do without the `Visitor` and `accept`? Feels like we're exposing an implementation detail here.
✏️  We usually put all member variables at the top of the class.
✏️  Constructor at the top after member variables.
❓ Should we mention what will get updated in the parent metacard? I couldn't figure it out.
✏️  Typo: `RETRY` instead of `RETY`.
❓ Do we need to make a defensive copy of the list?
❓ Any reason we try to coerce the `long` returned by `getHits` to an `int`? Couldn't we just make `expectedReturnCount` a `long`?
❗️ Since we're taking in a `Double` instead of `double` we may want to check for `null`.
❓ Do we absolutely need to make this method `final`? It's somewhat unusual to do this on an abstract class' method.
✏️ Nit: Extra white spaces.

❓ The type isn't `dict` it is `dict or NoneType`. In type hints this might be:\\```python\from typing import Dict Union\\assert_headers_absent: Union[Dict None]\```
❓ Either change this to `assert_ header_is_absent` or make it return a boolean and have the caller `assert header_is_absent...`

❗️ Use correct `Dispose()` pattern. The previous implementation was only allowed to be in `Dispose()` (as opposed to `Dispose(bool)`) because the type was sealed.
❕ Rename this file to **PatternMatcher.SimplePatternMatcher.cs**
❔ Does the new API preclude future work to optimize this case?
❔ Does the new API preclude future work to optimize this case?
❗️ So far moving this item to a field is what makes the least sense to me. Unlike `allowFuzzyMatching` which is a property of the `PatternMatcher` itself this field relates to a condition of the caller.
❕ This appears to be ignoring the `allowFuzzyMatching` property passed to the constructor
❔ Is the general practice in tests to ignore calling `Free` on these and/or it's a \"either way; doesn't matter\"?
❕ This appears to be ignoring the `allowFuzzyMatching` constructor argument
❕ You used `?.` here but you used `.` above. Either the `?.` is unnecessary here or the code above will throw.\\:bulb: If it's actually optional the parameter name or type should be updated to reflect this case.
❕ Rename this file to **PatternMatcher.ContainerPatternMatcher.cs**.
❕ None of these `PatternMatcher` instances get disposed.\\❗️ The `CompletionHelper` itself is a static instance meaning everything added to this map will hold a strong reference to the `PatternMatcher` for the life of the application.
❔ The original code had `StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries` and trimmed the segments after splitting. Is there a reason that was omitted here?
❔ Why is `culture` optional? If it would be considered a bad practice to omit it don't allow it to be optional.

⚠️  -  `where` can return a `-1` if not value is found if you then apply that to `circ` in newer versions of IDL you will get changed the last element of `circ`. You should use the `count` argument in `where` and only apply it to `circ` if `count > 0`.

✏️  If we can unit test this class through the public API we should change the visibility to `private`. Otherwise we should add a comment saying that it needs to be package-private for unit test.\❗️ We should make this class `static` if possible.
❗️ We can't just check if `size < pageSize` since it's possible that `size` is smaller because that's all the catalog framework will return and not because there's nothing else.
❗️ Once we check for negative page size we shouldn't need the if check on L104.
❗️ We should provide the ability to set the sort order.
❓ Should we mention that this class isn't thread safe?
❗️ We should consider having two classes here. One that hides the page size altogether and returns them one at a time using an `Iterator` or a `Stream` and another class that allows clients to specify a _guaranteed_ page size and returns batches or metac
❗️ We should add parameter validation to prevent `null` and `pageSize` <= 0.
❗️ This is not being used. We should either use it or remove it.
❓ Should we use `-1` here to get as many items as we can and get rid of `pageSIze` altogether?
❓ Should we hide all those exceptions? If we're hoping to have most of the code use this class instead of `query` method we may not want to change the error reporting too much. Thoughts?
❓ Should we add a constant for this but still allow clients to override the default value in the constructor?
❓ Instead of a page size should we consider asking for a maximum number of metacards the client wants to get? That would allow us to optimize the page size we send to the catalog framework on L141 and avoid retrieving more than what the client really wan

❗️ Unless there's a way to create a `SubscriptionIdentifier` with an invalid id or type name or to mutate those values afterwards we shouldn't need to call anything other than `notNull()`. As much validation as possible should be done in the `Subcriptio
❓ Can `MarshalledSubcription` enforce those constraints i.e. no `null` or empty filter and callback address? If so we should move those validations to that class.
❓ Should we simply log a debug message here and ignore? We could also consider overwriting the exiting entry and move on. Would throwing an exception from here be a problem?
❗️ We should add that check to the `SubcriptionType` class instead that way we don't need to validate it anywhere else.
✏️  Don't think we should leave these comments here since this is just speculation on possible future implementations and could become stale and misleading.
❗️ We should log something here.
✏️  May want to use `{@code}` for external classes and interfaces such as `javax.cache.Cache` and `EternalExpiryPolicy` and `{@link}` for our own `Subscription` interface.
❓ `if (!contains(identifier))` instead?
❓ Should we just log and ignore? Would throwing an exception from here be a problem?
❓ Is there a reason why we decided to have a `getId()` on `SubscriptionIdentifier`? Couldn't we have implemented `hashCode()` and `equals()` instead and use `SubscriptionIdentifier` objects as keys directly?
❓ Shouldn't we put the `SubscriptionFactory` on that class instead of here? Also if there's an expectation on clients (L124-125) we may want to put that in the interface's documentation.
❓ Should we add some of this information to the interface's JavaDoc? Sounds like the type match would be important to mention at least.

❓ Could we do something like a command usage e.g.:\\```\sh CertNew.sh (-dn <distinguished name> | <FQDN>) [-san <tag:name><tag:name>...]\```\And then give a description and a concrete example for each option?\\I'd also check with @ricklarsen to

❓ Same question throughout the review about mutability of these sets.
❓ Why is there all that white space prior to the CRLF? And why the space after it?
✏️ Ignoring the odd whitespace issue a better way to do this would be\```java\        return errorCodes.stream()\                .sorted()\                .collect(Collectors.joining(\"\\r\\n\"));\```
❓ Comma whitespace and then a return? I don't see the point. Should that be comma return then whitespace to indent? Is that the desired goal?
❗️ This is painfully inefficient. You're doing something akin to a map-reduce here with an accumulator but you're going to force hash collisions on each subsequent call as you re-add the current contents of the `allErrorCodes` collection to itself.\\Al
❓ Do we want this to be immutable? Do we care that callers can modify it? If we want immutability should either create with guava's `ImmutableSet` or wrap the return in an `UnmodifiableSet`.
❗️ Also while you can't change the `\\r` you should use `%n` in a format string not `\\n`.
❓ Should we be adding the MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD here? Seems like a function's error codes would only be from its arguments or any produced while executing. This seems more appropriate as an abstract method too if we want to force functions to return erro
❓ Just thought of this as I hit this but this will currently return the super errors (MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD in this case) and the errors that happen during execution. It seems this should actually be union of the super errors execution errors and func
❓ Would `getErrorCodes()` ever return null? Looks like it will always at least return an empty set. Can use `CollectionUtils.isEmpty(Collection)` to check for emptiness and null.\Also we should be able to pull this call on 49 and 52 into a local variable
❓ Should we be creating this through our internal API as its own function called `errorCodes`? Doesn't seem consistent with how we are doing everything else.

❓ Same comment as before why not simply call delete() on felixFIleOriginal thus avoiding the check if it is a file?
❗️ We should never throw RuntimeException directly. In this case this will be called from Felix's config admin since it is a listener. Is it wise to throw back an exception? Should we just log an error and continue?
❗️ Should not call create() directly
❓ Why not make it static? If not then no need for the config argument as the attribute would already be set when it is called.
✏️ Why not just log it and return null as opposed to throw an exception just to catch it above?  This would also properly trigger a cleanup of the pid tracking and old file.
❓ Why the need to convert back to a path and use Files as opposed to calling delete() on felixFileOriginal?\❗️ Files.delete() will throw a FileNotFoundException which I don't believe we care here.

❗️ By definition listConfigurations() could return null

❗️ Additional test cases to consider:\- listConfigurations() return null\- getConfiguration() return null\- file delete error (or return false if code changed)\- felix install file property set to invalid value\- IOException in event handler
❗️ Should use the org.slf4j.version property defined in parent pom (upgrade it required).
✏️ ... was not tracked and will not track pid
❗️ Why are we checking file1b?

❗️ Should mix strings URIs and URLs
✏️ Why not just log it and return null as opposed to throw an exception just to catch it above? This would also properly trigger a cleanup of the pid tracking and old file.
❗️ We shouldn't have to catch this one here. We should handle that below ... see other comment below where it is thrown.
✏️ Might just want to put a note indicating the logic is similar to the ConfigRepository in Karaf
❗️ It might be a good idea to use a ConcurrentHashMap as opposed to a simple hash map since it will be accessed by multiple threads.
❓ @stustison The default implementation of Felix's ConfigInstaller will currently write back the config file wherever the felix install file property points to which could be outside DDF_HOME. Are you saying we would have a problem with that?\\@Lambeaux
✏️  Should this say \"...deleting file for pid...\"?

✏️  These asserts could use a message. Why are you expecting 20L and 15?

✏️  Maybe include what maximum results means. Like what happens when I have more results than this maximum? Why set a maximum in the first place?

❓ What drove the change here from Arrays to Collections? 
❓ Is this change here mostly to clarify the ternary operator functionality?
✏️  It would help readability to extract the value 3 and set as a final constant at the top of the class.
✏️  It would be more readable to extract the string message to a local variable as well as extracting the call to the queryResponseArgumentCaptor to a local variable. We typically don't like having a lot of nested functionality inside assert statements

✏️  See the comments on the next test as they apply here as well.
✏️  It would help readability to extract the value 4 and set as a final constant at the top of the class. That would also help with your cacheQuery() call readability.
❗️ I notice this same method is called in your individual tests so is should this remain? Also the method name is rather vague leading a reader to wonder what the 2 is there for. Specifying that this sets up a mock would be very helpful.
❓ What value does having an actual QueryResponse bring versus simply a mock of a QueryResponse?
✏️ Changing the name to \"generateResultMock\" would increase the readability of the code when this method is invoked. In addition changing \"count\" to something more descriptive would help as well.
✏️  It would help readability to extract the value 2 and set as a final constant at the top of the class.

❓  Should this be just a \"_Note: _\" given its impact on implementations? 
✏️  This is fine but if we are committing to this at an API level should we put this in bold instead of italics? Also I think this is a big part of the API definition and should not be just a \"side-note\". I would remove the \"_Note:_\" prefix to this par
❓ If the `validator` can be null should we introduce the `@Nullable` annotation? 
❓ So the predicate has the power to cancel out error reporting? Can you elaborate more on this? What happens when the predicate is true *and* something is wrong with the property?

❓ If the `validator` can be null should we introduce the `@Nullable` annotation? 
✏️   Should `filter` be wrapped in a code XML element?
❓ If a migration entry can represent a file which is a collection of properties it doesn't make sense to now apply a different concept for system properties. For parity shouldn't we have all system properties share a single migration entry?

❓ Same question here. Should `path` be first? Does it make sense to do that just for consistency's sake? 
❓ Same question here about the mapping of individual system properties to migration entries when we map entire config files to entries. 
❓  Would it be more practical to return a service reference or the migratable itself? 
❓ This is not clear. Do I need to manually run an export on a brand new system before attempting an import? Or does this imply the system provides this ZIP file automatically? Should we consider naming it something special? Perhaps `defaults-${project.ver
❗️  In the catalog core API we often will provide property maps so we have a dynamic source of information transportation without impacting the API itself. Would it be a good idea to add a `Map<String Object>` for report properties?

❓ Should we put this in a `finally` block in case the `getNamespaces()` method fails? Had never heard of that `ungetService()` method before. Wonder if we always call it where we should...
❓ Use `Optional` instead of returning `null`? Or add `@Nullable`?
❓ Do we need to worry about `null` namespaces?

❓ Could we make this class package-private instead of public?
✏️  We should add JavaDoc comments here.
❗️ See synchronization comment above.
❗️ Since this is done in a for loop we may need to synchronize the whole loop to prevent any potential issues between this and the `remove()` in `unbind`.
❓ Should we log something here?
❓ Should we call the method `storeRequired()` (or something similar) and get rid of the `boolean` flag?
❓ Looks like we're creating this because of the possibility of having to deal with `IOException`s. Could we just stick with the simple `BiConsumer` and have implementers throw `UncheckedIOException` if needed? How bad would that be on clients?
❓ Couldn't we use a simple `BiConsumer` here and just have the `consumer` throw a `RuntimeException` like `UncheckedIOException`? Would save some code ;-)

✏️  Can we make sure that the `{` and `}` here don't break the JavaDoc generation?
❓ The relationship between `MigrationContext` and `MigrationEntry` is a little confusing especially since they both share similar methods. It might be worth providing some usage example(s) and how they can/should be used.
OK I did that ☝️

You can ignore this one ☝️.  I see that we are not following that style in many places in our codebase.

❓ Do we gain a whole lot by hiding the `String.format()` call from the clients? Feels like the little sugar coating increases the complexity of this code quite a bit. Thoughts?
❓ Curious. Any reason we got rid of the static imports?
❓ Should we also have the other \"Proxy\" classes delegate their `hashCode()` `equals()` and `toString()` methods in case those get implemented at some point? That way we won't forget to add them.

❓ I wonder if we shouldn't be really strict here and make sure that the file contains only one line and the version matches a specific pattern. That way if the format of that file is ever changed this code will break right away and people will know it n
❓ What if the path is invalid?
❓ Would it be worth adding a filter to skip the entries already in the map and simply call `put` at the end? That way we wouldn't be creating extra `ExportMigrationEntryImpl` when they are already in the map.
❗️ Since this will actual prevent the whole migration feature from coming up and potentially other bundles as well we should log an `error` here. We may also want to make the error message a little more specific i.e. what file failed to be loaded and i
❗️ `migrationEntry` or `entry` instead of `me`.
❓ What if the directory is invalid?
✏️ `memoryPath`
❓ Use the `ExportMigrationEntry` interface?
❓ With the current logic won't we end up creating a new `ExportMigrationEntryImpl` even if it does exist in the map?
❓ To make it clearer that this is adding something the report and not just logging like the method above should we rename it to `report...` or something?
✏️ Even though the name here is meant to indicate this is where the export was performed from an interface perspective wouldn't it make more sense to call the parameter `importDirectory` since it doesn't have and may not to match the export one?

❗️ If there's a problem with the import the side-effect of this `remove()` call on the iterator will be _really_ difficult to track down i.e. we're indirectly updating the `List` contained in the `ImportMigrationConfigurationAdminContext`'s `memoryFact
❓ Is it safe to modify the `Dictionary` that's being passed in? Shouldn't make a copy instead? If we keep the code this way we may want to add a comment on the constructor about the fact that the `Dictionary` may get modified.
❓ The code to build a `path` from the `DirectoryWatcher.FILENAME` property also exists in `ExportMigrationConfigurationAdminContext`. Would it be worth extracting that code somewhere common and eliminate as much of the repetitions as possible?
✏️ `mcfgs` isn't a well known or easy to decipher name. Can we use something like `memoryConfigs` or something along those lines instead?
❓ The methods to determine whether a `Configuration` is for a managed service or managed service factory are repeated in a couple of other places. Can we move them a common place and reuse them?
✏️ Should we use a guard clause here to reduce the indentations i.e. `if (restore) { return true; }`?
❓ Does this need to be `public`?
✏️ Since `from` is only used in the log statements should we call it something like `fromMessage` `fromLog` or something along those lines?
✏️ `importDirectory`? See comment above.
❗️ `zos` is a terrible name.

✏️ If we were to switch to the new `java.time` constructs we could avoid all this Date->long->Date work and just operate on higher level objects.\\Create an `Instant`; use object serialization to write it to disk; use object serialization to read it fr
✏️ This method would become _much_ simpler if you were to take the path of object serialization of the Date.

✏️ I would definitely not try to do this inside a lambda. Either extract the lambda to a private method or switch to an iterative solution.
✏️ There's too much to the lambda here and it gets in the way of seeing the basic flow of the stream. Recommend extracting the lambda as a private method.

✏️  This may be a good time to make this class compliant with our standards and remove all the `@NotNull` annotations and only use `@Nullable` on the parameters that _can_ be `null`.
❓ Do we need to check that `sessionIndexes` isn't `null` like we do for the other arguments?
❓ Did we add a unit test somewhere to make sure this method always behaves the same way whether we have session indices or not?
❓ Since it looks like we only need this to mock out the `UuidGenerator` could we either make this method package-private and annotate with `@VisibleForTesting` or inject it in the constructor and get rid of the setter?
✏️  Argument description is missing.
❓ Should this method be package-private like `checkPostSignature` etc.?\❓ If we make it package-private should we remove the `ValidationException` from the signature?

❗️ Since we care about what the messages say and assert on those we should be repeating them here like we used to instead of sharing constants with `LogoutRequerstService`. Otherwise the assertion doesn't mean much as the messages could be changed by mis
❓ Could we create the `SessionIndexBuilder` only once and reuse it instead of creating a new one each time?
❓ Do we really need this collection to be synchronized? The two methods that access this collection already are.
❗️ Based on the schema it looks like `SessionIndex` is optional so we should have tests with an `Assertion` that has an `AuthnStatement` without a `SessionIndex`.
❓ Can we catch specific checked exceptions and `RuntimeException` instead of all `Exception`s?
❓ Do we need to filter out any `null` or empty session indices? If not why not just do `new ArrayList(logoutRequest.getSessionIndexes())` instead of using a stream?
❗️ We shouldn't throw raw `RuntimeException`s.
❗️ We shouldn't be throwing raw `RuntimeException`s. Could we throw an `IllegalStateException` or even a `NullPointerException` instead?
❓ Should we extract `\"security.audit.roles\"` to a constant?\❓ It's very unlikely that the property won't exist but should we provide a default value just in case to make sure we never get a NPE?

✏️ Instead of this just return the `Optional` (skip the call to `orElse()`) above and then call `if (previous.isPresent())` here and then `previous.get()` as your input to `requiresPermission()`.
❓ This method is not the one missing its `@Override` annotation. The method with the signature `public Object visit(Or filter Object extraData)` is the one missing the annotation.
❗️ I see no reason that `gmdMetacardType` should ever have been `static`. It likely was a copy/paste error and was intended to be `final`.\\@glenhein do you concur?
❓You might wanna add the debug log if it's null.
❓I believe the old code used to throw the `OwaspDiffRunnerException` when we did a `.get()` on something that was null so you can use `orElseThrwow()` instead of setting it to null.
❗️ Sonarqube is correct. The only way `mBeanServer != null` is true is if the `objectName` has been set.
❗️ No need to call `orElse()` here is the `isPresent` check on the outer loop has determined it is available. Change to `.get()`.
❗️ Right. Whether the exception is thrown on the call to `IOUtils.toString()` or before it `msg` will still be null. Always always null.
✏️ Instead of relying on `orElse(null)` terminal operation + null test suggest leaning more on `Optional`. This code can also be cleaned a bit more like this:\\```java\          Optional<String> altNs = namespaceStack\              .stream()\       
❗️ I don't think you should make this change. Using an `Optional` as a parameter to a method/ctor is problematic for many reasons one of those reasons being the fact that you can't easily tell whether to check for null or ifPresent. On a cursory examinat
❗️ These should be returned to the way they were and `squid:S2209` should be suppressed. The justification is that this ctor is only here for the associated unit test.
✏️ Suggest trying this for this method: https://gist.github.com/coyotesqrl/a6cb0310bab0ab3a4760e492ee834670
❓ Can't see why you needed these methods.
❗️ Same comment as earlier regarding `objectName` and `mBeanServer`: if `mBeanServer` is non-null then `objectName` must be non-null as well.
✏️ Might as well just call `closeQuietly()` on this as well.
✏️ Can simplify the `if(cond1 || cond2...) then return true` to `return (cond1 || cond2...)`
❓ I believe the only thing that touches this code is its unit test.\\@stustison can this file (and its test) be deleted?
✏️ It would be much preferable to simply rename this private method so it does not look like an incorrect override.
✏️ Can simplify more by simply returning the conditions.

❌  This test is using mocking so much that it essentially repeats the implementation line by line. Only mock interactions that you care about. Use Stubs (or the real classes in case of simple data objects) for everything else.
❌ This applies to some of the other tests as well: This is over-asserting. Only mock the interactions that you are actually trying to test ideally one per test. Otherwise you'll bind the test so tightly to the implementation that it'll fail for all kinds
⭕️ You might want to add `&& !failed` to avoid repeatedly telling the delegate to stop.

❓Should we add `_KEY` at the end of those names to make it clear they are not the actual values but the key to look them up?
❗️We should also add the internal values in the `system.properties` file here as well.

❓General question for @stustison. Looks like we're exposing the IdP using the internal URL and the client code is also using the internal URL to access it. Will that cause problems in an HA configuration?

❗️We used to only print out the internal port numbers because those were the only things available. We probably should print out all the other values now. Or none of them.

✏️ `anyTextAttributesWhitelist` cannot be `null` (if it could marking with with `@Nullable` would help identify that it is a possibility going forward). As such why not simply calling `.isEmpty()` on it?
❗️ We should mark the attributes with `@Nullable` if we expect they can be
❓ How do we deal with synchronization issues now that the resolver can be changed from any threads whereas before it was final?
❓ Same question about being protected
✏️ By design it cannot be `null` so simply call its `.isEmpty()` method
❗️ This should be moved to the constructor to avoid potentially leaving `resolver` to `null` and making it clear that it can never be.
❓ Why does it have to be protected? Again opening up the implementation to outside changes.\
❗️ This method is meant to finalize the initialization of the object via its constructor and as such it must be private. Making it protected allows subclasses to override it and be called before their own constructor is ever called.
❗️ If `anyTextAttributesWhitelist` could be `null` as per your previous usage of `CollectionUtils.isEmpty()` instead of simply `anyTextAttributesWhitelist.isEmpty()` you would get a NPE here.
✏️  The code now ends up searching the `key` string twice for the `TEXT_SUFFIX`. Instead how about doing this:\```\final int i = key.indexOf(SchemaFields.TEXT_SUFFIX);\\if (i != -1) {\   String attributeName = key.substring(0 i);\  ...\```
❓ Should we actually pass in `null` now since the constructor was modified to support nulls?
❓ Can we not expose the internal list for testing? This makes the tests brittle. It also opens up the implementation to unexpected changes.
❓ Does it have to be protected?
❗️ This should also be done in the ctor to clarify that the `provider` attribute should never be `null` in this class. Plus it would allow it to remain `final` making it clear it doesn't change and making thus avoiding any potential multi-threading issue 
❗️ Do we support the list to be `null`? I don't think we should and as such we should only need to call its `.isEmpty()` method. In any case you would get a NPE in the above line. In addition. `addAll()` would take care of the case when there is no elem

✏️ Managing this many command line arguments by hand is fragile and brittle. Suggest a library. I've used [this one](https://github.com/spullara/cli-parser) on many projects before.

Please add semicolon and new line (try to follow eslint standard - I know that sometimes it's not possible ☹️)
The wording is from my memory on Grade-X when GBS was written ????‍♂️  The thing is the wording implies X is somewhere between A and C which isn't really the case.
I totally agree and as I wrote in the Misc ☝️  it should be a part of the single config file. \However I don't know what will be implemented/published first. Also I don't want to create PRs with hundreds of changes in them =)
I think it's useful to separate different entry points of integration. `extendPreview` and `extendManager` technically also could be removed ????‍♂️

✏️ Could just return a new dataStore.
✏️ You can remove the else block since in javascript if a function doesn't return a value it returns `undefined`
✏️ Could be refactored to...\\```\function pad(num width padValue = '0') {\    let numStr = num.toString();\    if (numStr.length < width) {\        numStr = padValue.repeat(width - numStr.length);\    }\    return numStr;\}\```\

❓ Is the `2` significant enough to create a constant?
✏️ Similar refactor to the `pad` function could be applied here too
✏️ Similar refactor to `ddToDmsCoordinateLat` here

❓ Is it no longer possible to get multiple matching sessions as before?
✏️ By convention when returning streams in Java the method shouldn't be prefixed with `get` and there shouldn't be a need to suffix it with `Stream`. So in this case it would be called `sessionAttributes`.
✏️ By design a stream cannot be modified so there are no reasons for first wrapping it in an unmodifiable collection.
✏️ Easier to read if you create a private method named something like `isSessionNotExpired` and reference that as your filter.
✏️ Easier and more optimal to add `.orElse(null)` above after the `findFirst()` and store that in a `String` variable instead of the optional. Then here you can simply test if not `null`. You then avoid the double check for `null` that will occur in `isP

✏️ Annotate the method with @Nullable
❗️ Do not catch `Throwable` without first catching `VirtualMachineError` and throwing them back without doing anything first.
✏️ Avoid this comment by initializing it to 0 and move `context.incrementRefCount()` outside of the if/else so it applies to both cases. That makes it more obvious that you are increment the ref count no matter what.
❗️ Make it final to ensure it is never modified otherwise you will need to deal with possible concurrency factors when you access it later.
❓ Should we still continue like nothing happened?\❗️ Let's log exception stack traces at debug level.
❓ Is it guaranteed to be an instance of `HandlerCollection`? Should we not protect ourselves against that to be safe?
I really like this ☝️ 
➡️ Resolving this by throwing an exception (AD0001) since it's not expected.
Thank you for cleaning up things as you work through the codebase. It's great. ❤️ 
just cleaning things up a bit ????‍♂️ 
@crysfel @arecvlohe ☝️ does this make sense?

❓ info or trace?
❓ Were these changes part of your work or are you out-of-date with master?
❓ info or trace?
❗️ Please prefer American English spellings in Codice projects.
✏️ `String.format()` would read better here I think.
❓ Do you want to change this to extend RT exception instead or is this component test just a special case where you don't care about the checked exception?
❓ As you didn't end up using `tinybundles` for your testing purposes do we still need this feature?

❓ Same question about whether these changes were part of your work.
✉️ Please don't forget to post to the Google DDF Dev group about this change as it will impact downstream projects & integrators.
✏️ Should be able to swap in method reference on this line since it's not negated.
✏️ Extract a method instead of nesting this multi-line lambda.
✏️ Seems inefficient to create a collection just to iterate over it. Might want another method `toStream()` here and then do a `forEach` or a `map`/`collect`.\\Another argument for making your exception a runtime exception.
❓ Same question about not using `tinybundles`.
✏️ I think refactoring the \"get a joined list of this set of bundles\" functionality should be refactored to a method.
❓ Why is this the only status that's statically imported?
✏️ This should be `ExampleMSFInstance.class` yes? Or are you sharing the logger across multiple classes?
❓ I suspect this is fine but OSGi won't care that this isn't technically an interface? It's doing the contract extraction from the plain bean? 
❓ This class and `ExampleService` seem almost identical. Is there merit to keeping them both? 
❓ Could you just use the enum's `name()` method to get what you need instead of writing a map? Might look like this assuming nullable since you added an \"UNKNOWN\" state:\```\bundle.getState() == null ? \"UNKNOWN\" : bundle.getState().name()\```\Could be

✏️ `org.codice.ddf.platform.syncinstaller`? 
❓ Is the `blueprintBundleContext` already available in the container or do you need a bean or reference to it too? 
⭕️ To avoid the cast to `ICoreRunnable` you could declare it as `ICoreRunnable` rightaway.
❌ nit: `syncOperation`
⭕️ This could use `Optional.orElseThrow()` to get a better failure message when the project is not a Gradle project.
Yup. No need to test this component really ????‍♂️ 
❓ Should this be `return parse_regalia`? As currently written it looks like it will call `parse_regalia` but then exit the `else` and return the value of `result.each_...` on the next line.\\
same as other type comments ☝️

❓ Can you clarify the units? milliseconds?

❓ Can you clarify the units? milliseconds?
✏️ By convention in Java a method that returns a Stream should not be prefixed with get. In this case it should be called `configurations()`

❓ Is this optional? Can it be `null`? If so please annotated with `@Nullable`
❓ Is this optional? Can it be `null`? If so please annotated with `@Nullable`
❓ `waitAndUpdateManagedService()`
✏️ At the minimum remove `api` or just `org.codice.ddf.platform.installer`
❗️ This assumes that the bundle in which this class is defined has permissions to monitor any or all services. the policy file should be updated and privileges should be extended for this to work.
✏️ Might want to trace which features?
❗️ For operations that wait I would expect a timeout exception to be thrown back so a client can make the difference between an error and a timeout. Even if that exception was to extend the `SynchronizedInstallerException` I would still document it in t
✏️ javadoc. I would add a note to make sure this is never a `SynchronizedConfigurationListener` as we want to make sure we are notified from the same pool of threads that are used to dispatch asynchronous configuration events.
❓ Why not just `String... features`?
❓ `waitForServiceToBeAvailable()`?
❗️ Do catch `PrivilegedActionException` too in order to include its contained exception as the cause instead of this container exception.
✏️ Might want to trace which bundles?
❓ `waitForBundlesToBeActive()`?
❓ Why not just `String... bundles`?
❓ Can you clarify the units? milliseconds?
✏️ Do we realize that such an update will never catch all possible updates to properties of a given managed service? A lot of code goes directly to config admin including DDF's own config admin felix config installer ...
❓ `waitForServiceToBeAvailable()`?
❓ Why not use the `DictionaryMap` class?
✏️ `MapUtils.isEmpty()`
❓ `waitAndUpdateManagedService()`?
✏️ Might want to trace which bundles?
❗️ Should catch `PrivilegedActionException` too.
✏️ This trace will appear in every loop where we check we might want to move it to `trace` or simply remove it since in any case we are not really waiting here but just checking if the listener was called or not.
❗️ Should wait for the reminder amount of time from the beginning of the method until this point.
❓ Can you clarify the units? milliseconds?
❗️ At this point you should wait for whatever is left since you already waited a bit above. Otherwise a client saying to wait for 5 seconds might end up waiting for 10 seconds.
❗️ Make this volatile as it is designed to be updated/accessed by multiple threads
❓ Can you clarify the units? milliseconds?
❗️ Should wait for the reminder amount of time from the beginning of the method until this point.
❓ Do we really want to re-bound to a new location if it turned out it was already bound? The above `getConfiguration()` would either bound to the provided location if this is the first time it was retrieved or simply return the configuration that is bound
❓ Can you clarify the units? milliseconds?
❓ Should we document all classes in this package with?\\ ```\ * <p><b> This code is experimental. While this interface is functional and tested it may change or\ * be removed in a future version of the library. </b>\```
❓ Why not pass the location on the call to `createFactoryConfiguration()`?
✏️ Replace `toDict()` with simply `new DictionaryMap(properties)`
✏️ Might want to trace which features?
❗️ I don't think you need to worry about those already installed let the featureService handle that properly.
❓ Why not make the enum set a constant to avoid creating it each time?
thanks I missed that check for false ????‍♀️ . Fixed
❓Just to make sure I understand if `getCount() == 0` we only want to get the number of \"hits\"? If that's accurate should we change the `Query` object to only retrieve one result? We don't need to retrieve more than that to get the count.
❓Are we putting a limit on the `cqlRequest.getCount()` to make sure we don't blow up the heap when we collect all the results?
✏️ Might be worth extracting private methods with clear names (e.g. `retrieveHitCount()` and `retrieveResults()`) or add comments explaining what the `if` and `else` blocks do.
Just a preference of mine. I prefer using normal package names for APIs and something like impl for the actual implementation. But I tagged the comment with ✏️ so it is up to you.
I would add links here: Vector Tiles to the glossary (already included ✨  https://carto.com/help/glossary/) and Mapbox Vector Tile Specification to the mapbox documentation.
Mmh... how exactly was this rule failing the linting? ???? I’d check myself but until the end of this week I only have access to an iPad and no real computer to do so. ????????‍♂️

✏️ I am personally really not a fan of injecting an internal thing like this.
❓ Why read as a string and then parse? Why not parse directly from a FileReader?
✏️ Just let it bubble out of the test and fail the test that way
✏️ I would definitely like to see tests for conditions like:\- destroy called before init is done\- init timing out\- destroy called before init starts\- ...\The idea is to tests all possibilities of race conditions between the 3 threads involved
❓ Should this test be done under the next one for `!isConfigDeleted()`? What is the point to trace that if we won't start them anyway?
✏️ timeout should be a long for consistency with other the other constructor
❗️ This method is invoked from a different thread and by not synchronizing first on `initState` before the loop there is a chance that `destroy()` could be called while we are iterating through all.
❓ Why not call the other constructor with all values?
❗️ Make sure that all access and writes to `routeCollection` are protected under the same lock since they are accessed/updated at init and destroy time
✏️ No need to check first the `Executor` api indicates it will be a no-op if already shutdown
❗️  destroy might actually be called before the thread is calling `waitFor()` or even before. You need to ensure your condition for the tests. In addition you need to make sure that even if the test fails the thread is ended before you leave here. Which
❓ What is the point for the `TransformerJsonFile` if at the end of the day you are just deserializing a list of strings?\Simply do:\`gson.fromJson(json new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}.getType())`\

✏️ Nothing of value in an `InterruptedException` to log.
❓ Do we need to continue on to the next service reference or should we break out of the loop?
❗️ Move it to include everything in this method

Not sure that this is needed.\\For example when package `docker-ce` is held:\\```shell\▶ dpkg-query -f '${Status} ${Version}' -W docker-ce                                                           \hold ok installed 5:18.09.0~3-0~ubuntu-bionic\```

❌ This test coverage can be moved to `AbstractCppIntegrationTest` in order to target all components instead of duplicating the test case.
❌ According to the release notes of Clang 6.0.0 the default should be GNU C++14 (from GNU C++98).\
❌ At this stage configuring the source compatibility should only be allowed at the component level. The internal API may allow to configure it but that should only be done by the native plugins.
❌ Use `getProject().getObject().property(CppSourceCompatibility.class)` instead of injecting an `ObjectFactory`.
❌ We should consider [this document](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support) to resolve this TODO. Basically I think we could choose the following default:\- VS2010 -> C++03\- VS2013 -> C++11\- VS2015 -> C++14\- VS2017 -> C++17
❌ Instead of passing the version inside the constructor and causing lots of waterfall changes I think we should simply set the version on the `spec` [here](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/subprojects/platform-base/src/main/java/org/gradle/la
❌ This would go away with the change explained above.
❌ This would also go away with the change explained above.
❌ Same as above moving this method to `CppCompilerArgsTransformer` simplify it greatly. For starter the `spec` is already typed as `CppCompileSpec`. To work around the need for compiler type I would simply create 2 types just as we did for Visual C++. 
❌ There is a missing coverage when the source compatibility isn't set. It should result in the spec property to be null.
❌ Move this to `CppCompilerArgsTransformer` by overriding this method like this:\```\@Override\public List<String> transform(CppCompileSpec spec) {\    List<String> args = super.transform(spec);\    addSourceCompatibilityArgs(spec args);\    return
❌ We should split this test. It's not good practice to unroll a test in this way. If we want to cover multiple source compatibility this way we should consider adding the content of the source file inside the where clause. To make it more readable the c

✏️ Do you think calling this method `processed` would be clearer?
❓Since there can only be one listener should we call the method `setListener` instead?
✏️ `parent` instead of `entry`?
❓Is there a reason why we use the `@Nullable` annotation on those fields? I understand that GSON calls the default constructor which leaves the field `null` until all the deserialization process is complete but once it's all done this field shouldn't be
❓If this is only visible for testing can we make it package-private (no modifier) instead of `protected`? Otherwise it looks it is meant to be used or overridden by sub-classes.
❓Since it doesn't look like we don't need anything but `rootFile` could we simply serialize that field? Might help avoid having to deal with a `null` `rootFile`.\We could also consider letting this class do the serialization instead of doing from anothe
❓Going back to my suggestion above I wonder if we couldn't make this method `static` and have it deserialize the `rootFile` and return an instance of this class something like this:\\```\public static AsyncFileAlterationObserver load(String fileName)
❗️We should add a comment in the class description and/or constructor saying that `setParent()` must be called after deserialization.
❗️We need to be careful here because we're adding a node to the parent node outside of any synchronization block which could cause problems.
✏️Should we rename the `remaining` variables in this class to something a little more meaningful?
✏️ We may want to use a different argument name for `listener` here (`listenerCopy`? Can't think of a good name...) to avoid any potential confusion with the field name. I know it got me confused ????
❓Should we use the comment as the log message and get rid of the comment? Also since this shouldn't happen hundreds of times we may want to consider increasing the logging level to `info()` so admins can see it.
❓Should we call this method `initChildFileEntries()` or `loadChildFileEntries()` instead? `Helper` doesn't really describe what this method do.
✏️ We should try to keep the `public` methods at the top. Method order is usually `public` `protected` package-private then `private`.
❓The logic is a little bit confusing here. If we're trying to know whether the file entry still exist in the tree should we just have a method called something like `isStillChildOfParent()` that returns a `boolean` and do something like this instead?\\
❗️Unless I'm mistaken this will prevent some of the child files from being visited as soon as one fails. Is this really what we want? Should we just initialize `errors = false;` and set it to `true` as when a `child` fails to be visited but still keep g
✏️Feel free to remove these/all `@NotNull` in this class. Our convention is that anything not annotated with `@Nullable` won't be `null`.

❗️ This should probably be package private since it is only required by the persistence manager and therefore could return the map as is as opposed to cloning it. Worst case scenario could you not just return an unmodifiable version of it?
❗️ Agreed. Such a method should not be in the API at all. It should be defined in a service and allow the implementation to register the service. In addition identification should be done via the object's interface and not the implementation's class.
❗️ It is also not a good idea to call non-final protected or public methods as they could be overridden by subclasses which means you would be calling into them before the subclass got intialized
❗️ My issue here is that you are relying on the subclass to update the `properties` attribute. This implies a shared responsibility of this attribute which can lead to complications if a subclass doesn't follow proper guidelines.\\It should probably als
✏️ Reverse the test to throw the `IllegalArgumentException` as opposed to returning and leaving the error path after.

✏️ To alleviate all the type casting everywhere and the need to expose access to the `properties` map I would suggest creating the following protected method in the base class:\\```\protected <T> T get(String id) {\  return (T)properties.get(id);\}
❓ If we don't support putting `null` as values in the map we should maybe consider using `contains()` instead?
✏️ If there is no need for clients of this API to have access to `setProperties()` then I would suggest putting this check as part of the above constructor and avoid the issue I mentioned in my comments to the base class constructor which calls this metho
✏️ If there is an expectation that an implementation throws an `IllegalArgumetException` for a certain reason than this should be documented in the parent class along with the contract for this method

❗️ Previous comment on having ID and possible name handled by the base class.
✏️  If you are just calling the default constructor then you can simplify this with `impl.newInstance()`
❗️ We need to account for object versioning so that we can handle upgrades later.
❓ If we are considering `name` to be common for all configuration objects then it should be moved to the base class and handled there just as for the `id`.
❓ When would it ever be a string? From the implementation of the `writeToMap()` it will always be a boolean.
❓ What is the point of this attribute if we do not save it?
❗️ kclass should be parameterixed as Class<? extends Persistable>
❗️ If we intend to store the attribute as a boolean indicating bidirectional or not then why are we keeping it internally as an enum? We should go one way or the other but not have a mix of both.
❗️ The default implementation should extract the ID from the map and the documentation should state that each subclass should first call its super implementation.
❓ How would that ever happen? If it does then why would we continue with the first one? Why not the second? Point being there is a system issue here and a debug trace is definitely not enough
❗️ filling up the ID should be the responsibility of the base class. I would suggest changing the prototype of the `writeToMap()` method to `public void writeToMap(Map<String Object> properties)` letting the caller passing in the map to be populated. The
✏️ annotate `o` with `@Nullable`
❓ Should we at least log the exception? I fear we will loose info about why it really failed as we are not piggy backing the exception as the cause of the new one.
❗️ See below for proposed change to the prototype. The default implementation here should write out the ID to the map. The documentation should also clearly state that a subclass should always call its super version first.
❗️ By convention in Java a method that returns a `Stream` is never prefixed with `get`. A `getObject()` method returns an object a `getObjects()` returns a collection. For a stream we typically see `objects()` `configs()`  `persistables()`
❗️ You should check that you are receiving an instance of `AbstractPersistable` before blindly typecasting. If not then you can throw a more appropriate error than letting a `ClassNotFoundException` bubble out.
❗️ We should use the lenient limit
❗️ Previous comment on prototype and having ID and possibily name handled by the base class.
❗️ The id should be extracted by the base class so the first thing any implementation of this method should do is to call super to let the base class handle common attributes as opposed to repeating this in every subclasses.
❗️ I don't think we should return an optional here. If one is asking for a specific id and it is not found than a `NotFoundException` should be thrown out.
❗️ The base class should have a copy constructor from which it initializes the id as opposed to letting the subclasses initializes the attributes of the baseclass
❗️ `kclass` should be parameterixed as `Class<? extends Persistable>`
✏️ I suggest you create a private method that creates and reads from a map in one shot. This will simplify streaming this whole process as opposed to creating a temporary collection.

✔️ \Now that 'context' parameters are moved to a separate argument we just stringify the entire `params` object.
✔️ (with `|| {}` instead of `|| []`)
✔️ \I also split out the 'context' parameters into a separate argument.
✔️ \I did something similar: Debug-related arguments (port config debugger path) now live in the optional property `params.debugArgs`. We replace `isDebug` with a truthiness check on `debugArgs`.
✔️ \These parameters are no longer optional (they are instead members of the optional `debugArgs` parameter) these checks are no longer necessary.
✔️ \\Now that these methods have been moved into `CloudFormation` there is no longer a shadowing issue. So I changed the name to match `getResourceFromTemplate`.
I guess what you suggest does the same thing. I suppose I like code that forces each path of the `if` to make a choice ????‍♂

I really like the structure of these tests.\I can imagine moving the commands and the expected output to a JSON-file and executing all tests with a single `it.each`. ❤️ 
☝️ oh yeah connected to that we should document that 'styled radio buttons' are now 'anchor' orrrrr `pseudo-radio-box`? Wait should add custom be adding a type of `pseudo-radio-box`?
Actually glad my previous comments got lost!\\I made one about is there a need for these partials and its only on second review the reason hit me ????‍♂

⚠️ I've opted to remove the `_paymentAmount == _currentOwedSalary` check and just use `_getLastPayrollDate()` directly. It's a little bit more expensive in the case where you're drawing out all of your currently owed salary but reduces the complexity.\

Maybe we can just throw away stupid Scallop and came back with `TaskApp` solution once.\????‍♂ 
Sounds good - I was aiming to reuse the code for `StatSummaryRequest` but you're right we're only using the `ResourceSelection` selector so an `EdgesRequest` type is more clear. ✅

I think `lockfile` might make sense after all: it has packages that don't show up in `go.mod` and technically a checksum is like an additional lock on the version ????‍♂

No decision behind this I was just scrambling at stuff ????‍♀️ I'd rather rely on as much 'native' reason bindings as possible so have gone back to Array. Sucks having to convert to List but eh.

Right. Good point. I spent all that time refactoring `create_grid` but don't actually use it. ????‍♂ .

⚠️ The test for `ListRules` now depends on `CreateRule`. Let's try to avoid that and do a straightforward DB query to set the stage database-wise for these tests. 
✏️ I don't think we need to perform the check. If the set does not contain the string it just won't remove it. 
✏️ We can make this styled CSS component more granular so that we don't need to specify based on classname. This may also help us remove things like the `!important`
❓ Why is this a div? It may be more appropriate as a `span` or `p` tag
❓ Are we passing the `className` down because we want to do some sort of conditional rendering/styling?

⚠️ We should pass in the current cache to `init()` so that the initializer can update any stale contract values that are not emitted as events (e.g. balances).
